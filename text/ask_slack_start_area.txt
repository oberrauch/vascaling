Hello Ben and all others interested!

## WHAT AM I DOING:

I'm still working on the implementation of the 'original' volume/area scaling model. So far, the basic structure seems to work and the model produces some sensible results. However, I have issues estimating the glacierâ€™s surface area `A_0` at the beginning of the model integration (i.e. 1850, since I'm working with HistAlp cliamte data). As described in Ben's sea level rise paper, the initial surface area "is estimated by iteratively seeking that surface area in the starting year of the integration that will result in the measured surface area in the year of the measurement."

## WHERE IS THE PROBLEM:

The main problem is: for some glaciers the model is not able to produce a surface area closed to the measured in 2003 for any initial surface `A_0`. Not even  It seems like the climate forcing is much more important than the initial glacier geometry. Additionally, the larger the initial area the smaller the final glacier area after around 150 years of model evolution. I prepared some plots for different glaciers, to illustrate my problem.

## INCLUDE PLOTS

The plots show the modeled evolution of glacier area over the HistAlp climate period, given different initial values for `A_0`.

## AKS FOR HELP

While it is more than possible that I have some bugs in my code, all equations, units, ... are tripple checked at this point. So I'm happy for any suggestions... Thank's so far.
