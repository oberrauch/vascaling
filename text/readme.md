# Read me

**Intersting/important files:**

- equilibrium_runs.md





- `asking_slack.md`: Lists of questions to all OGGM members (though they were mainly aimed at Ben), regarding the following topics:

  - Scaling parameters (constant and exponent) for the volume/area and volume/length scaling, respectively.
  - Response times or better time scales for length and area adjustment.
  - Iterative process of finding the best historic start area.

  By questions I mean a longer explanation of the problem, including comments from Slack and a subsequential attempt of an answer.

- `bens_matlab_model.md`: decomposition of Ben's original Matlab code, with focus on the scaling parameters and time scales.

- `commitment_run.md`: First I'll deconstruct the commitment run for the Rofental glaciers, given in the [OGGM documentation](http://docs.oggm.org/en/latest/run.html). This includes the `run_random_climate()` task from the `oggm.climate` module. Next I'll try to figure how to apply it to the VAS model.

- `continuous_integration.md`: During the process of merging the VAS model into the OGGM codebase, I stumbled upon Travis CI and coveralls.io. Since I had no idea what I'm doing, I tried to understand the concept of CI in general and the use of Travis and Coveralls. (Turns out, I still don't...)

- `equilibrium_runs.md`: comparing equilibrium runs with constant and random climate scenarios between the flowline model and the VAS model.
