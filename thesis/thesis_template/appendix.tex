\chapter{Large Quantities of Data}\label{appA}
\thispagestyle{plain}

Large quantities of data should be placed in an appendix. They should only be
``summarized'' in the chapter Results. Another way is to present
some representative cases together with some extreme cases in the chapter
Results. In any case, there should always appear a reference to the appendix in
the main part of the thesis.
