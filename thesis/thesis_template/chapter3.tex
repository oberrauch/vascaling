\chapter{Results}\label{chap3}
\thispagestyle{plain}

This chapter contains a detailed description of your findings. It shows
\emph{what has been found} to answer the scientific questions. Hence, it
consists of the author's original contributions. This chapter is the
``heart'' of a science thesis.


% ==== SECTION 1 ===============================================================
\section{Some Important Things to Know}\label{3sec:1}

It is important to differentiate between \emph{facts} and \emph{interpretations}
and between \emph{your contributions} and \emph{those of others}! Facts and
your contributions are part of this chapter. Interpretations and contributions
of others should be rather part of the chapter Discussion.


\subsection{Experimental Parts in the Chapter Results}
Experimental details should only appear in the chapter Results to the
extent necessary to ensure comprehension. Painstaking descriptions of
instruments, analysis procedures, field conditions, etc., should be part of the
chapter Methodology. However, absolutely necessary is information that shows
the \emph{reliability} of the findings and the \emph{robustness} of an
innovation (e.g., a new analysis technique).


\subsection{Numerical Results or so-called Data}
Results are more than simply numbers! They are tiny but unique
\emph{messages}. Data should not only be made ``visible'' (e.g., in
figures, such as in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}) but should also be made
\emph{articulate}.


\subsection{Order of Presentation}
Use chapters and (sub)sections to separate, e.g., various topics,
questions, and problems, or to separate measurements from calculations. 
Arrange information in a consistent way, e.g., from simple to complex, from
small to large (or vice versa in terms of scales: e.g., from
synoptic-scale to micro-scale), from \emph{most important} (central) to
\emph{least important} (peripheral). Arrange the material in order to maximize
impact rather than sticking to a strict chronological order. Try to tell a story
that consists of a beginning, followed by a gradual unfolding, and a
``happy end''.


\subsection{Cross-References}
You can always refer to other parts of your thesis like in the following
example: See chapter \ref{chap2} or section \ref{1sec:3} or
Fig.~\ref{fig:1} or Table~\ref{tab:1} or equation~(\ref{2equ:1}).


\section{Figure}\label{3sec:2}
Figure \ref{fig:1} shows an example for an EPS figure with two panels. The
topography of the Wipp Valley and Inn Valley is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1a}.
Figure~\ref{fig:1b} shows the time series of potential temperature at two
stations. In order to refer to a certain range of figure panels write, e.g.,
Fig.~\ref{fig:1a}--\subref{fig:1b}.

location of Innsbruck (IBK), Ellboegen (ELB), and Sattelberg
(SAB).}\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}


This template uses the \texttt{subfigure} environment with the option
\texttt{FIGTOPCAP} to place the subfigure labels (\subref{fig:1a}) and
(\subref{fig:1b}) at the top of the figure. However, since we want to have the
caption at the bottom of figure, use \verb|\figuretopcapfalse|
before the first \verb|\subfigure| command within the \texttt{figure}
environment, otherwise the figure number produced by \verb|\ref| is wrong.


\section{Table}
Table \ref{tab:1} is an example for a table that consists of several
rows and columns. Here, the \texttt{tabular} environment is used inside the
\texttt{table} environment.


\begin{table}[!htb]

\begin{footnotesize}
\renewcommand{\tabcolsep}{4pt}
\begin{tabular}{l p{3.5cm} l l l}

\section{Figure and Table Captions}

Figure and table captions \emph{must} contain all necessary information to
understand the \emph{content} of the figure and table, without the need of
additional text. Only in case of very complicated figures or tables, the caption
may end with a remark such as ``See text for further explanation''. The
\emph{interpretation} of the table or figure is not part of the caption, but
should be given in the main text. In order to avoid repetitions, the phrase
``As in Fig. xx, but for \dots'' is often used. Necessary information provided
in the caption is a description of
\begin{itemize}
\item shown parameters together with units,
\item date and time,
\item contour intervals,
\item location,
\item line styles and markers,
\item and others.
\end{itemize}
A list of figures and a list of tables at the beginning of the thesis (before
chapter 1) is optional.



\section{Title}

The title of your science thesis should be kept as short as possible. It should
represent an extremely compact summary of the thesis. The title should provide a
clear and complete description of the topic and should contain many keywords
(``what?'', ``how?'' and possibly ``why?''). The main title should not contain
more than 10 words. An optional subtitle may be used if necessary (all together
not more than 25 words). Important words and terms should be placed at the
beginning of the title. Avoid unspecific expressions such as
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Investigation of ...
\item[] Experiments on ...
\item[] Results of ...
\item[] Attempts to ...
\end{itemize}
Rather use expressions such as
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Influence of ... on ...
\item[] Generation of ... with ...
\item[] Dependence of ... upon ...
\item[] Optimization of ... upon ...
\end{itemize}
Avoid technical abbreviations or acronyms and special symbols such as IR
for infrared or $\theta$ for potential temperature.


\section{Abbreviations and Symbols}
Abbreviations (e.g., ECMWF) and symbols (e.g., $\vec{v}_g$) have to be
defined, i.e. explained, at the place where the \emph{first} appear in the text.
For example: The model was initialized with the operational analysis of the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). From the ECMWF
fields of geopotential height we derive the geostrophic wind vector
$\vec{v}_g$. The change of $\vec{v}_g$ with pressure $p$ reveals the thermal
wind equation.

A list of abbreviations and a list of symbols at the beginning of the thesis
(before chapter 1) is optional.


\section{Parameters and Units}

Use italic letters for scalar quantities (e.g., $R$ and $g$), bold upright
letters or arrows for vector quantities (e.g., $\mathbf{v}_g$ or $\vec{v}_g$)
and sans-serif letters for tensors (e.g., $\mathsf{T}$). All this parameters
should be written in mathematical mode (\verb|$ ... $|). Units should be
written with normal upright letters (e.g., m~s$^{-1}$). Use spacing between
numbers and individual units (e.g., $\phi=100$~W~m$^{-2}$). Less or no spacing
is used between numbers and units in case of percent and degrees (e.g.,
10\% and 5$^{\circ}$C). See also Table~\ref{tab:1} for further examples.


\section{Footnotes}
Do not use footnotes in an extensive way. Footnotes distract the reader from the
main body of the document. Do not use footnotes for referring to literature,
rather use the author-year citation system together with a bibliography (list
of references) at the end of the thesis.
