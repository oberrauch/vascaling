This \LaTeXe{} template is based on my own dissertation. It has been extensively
modified within the framework of the course \emph{Introduction to Scientific
Working} which I taught at the University of Innsbruck in the winter semester
2009/2010 for students of the \emph{Atmospheric Sciences Master Program}. It
does \emph{not} serve as the official thesis template of the Institute of
Meteorology and Geophysics (IMGI), however, it follows some reasonable rules,
such as the reference and citation guidelines of the American Meteorological
Society. Before using this template at IMGI, make yourself familiar with the
format guidelines of the Faculty of Geo- and Atmospheric Sciences and
the personal preferences of your advisor. My \LaTeX{} knowledge is based on the
guides of \citet{oeti08Aag} and \citet{kopk99Aag}. Many ideas on the content and
structure of a science thesis are taken from the book of \citet{russ06Aag}. This
template is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but \emph{without
any warranty}. I am looking forward to receiving comments for
improvements.\footnote{\texttt{alexander.gohm [at] uibk.ac.at}}
