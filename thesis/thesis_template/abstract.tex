The abstract is a short summary of the thesis. It announces in
a brief and concise way the scientific goals, methods, and most important
results. The chapter ``conclusions'' is not equivalent to the abstract!
Nevertheless, the abstract may contain concluding remarks. The abstract
should not be discursive. Hence, it cannot summarize all aspects of the thesis
in very detail. Nothing should appear in an abstract that is not also
covered in the body of the thesis itself. Hence, the abstract should be the
last part of the thesis to be compiled by the author.

A good abstract has the following properties: \emph{Comprehensive:} All major
parts of the main text must also appear in the abstract. \emph{Precise:}
Results, interpretations, and opinions must not differ from the ones in the main
text. Avoid even subtle shifts in emphasis. \emph{Objective:} It may contain
evaluative components, but it must not seem judgemental, even if the thesis
topic raises controversial issues. \emph{Concise:} It should only contain the
most important results. It should not exceed 300--500 words or about one page.
\emph{Intelligible:} It should only contain widely-used terms. It should
not contain equations and citations. Try to avoid symbols and acronyms (or at
least explain them). \emph{Informative:} The reader should be able to quickly
evaluate, whether or not the thesis is relevant for his/her work.

An Example: The objective was to determine whether \dots (\emph{question/goal}).
For this purpose, \dots was \dots (\emph{methodology}). It was found that \dots
(\emph{results}). The results demonstrate that \dots (\emph{answer}).
