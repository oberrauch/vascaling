% The abstract is a short summary of the thesis. It announces in
% a brief and concise way the scientific goals, methods, and most important
% results. The chapter ``conclusions'' is not equivalent to the abstract!
% Nevertheless, the abstract may contain concluding remarks. The abstract
% should not be discursive. Hence, it cannot summarize all aspects of the thesis
% in very detail. Nothing should appear in an abstract that is not also
% covered in the body of the thesis itself. Hence, the abstract should be the
% last part of the thesis to be compiled by the author.

% A good abstract has the following properties: \emph{Comprehensive:} All major
% parts of the main text must also appear in the abstract. \emph{Precise:}
% Results, interpretations, and opinions must not differ from the ones in the main
% text. Avoid even subtle shifts in emphasis. \emph{Objective:} It may contain
% evaluative components, but it must not seem judgemental, even if the thesis
% topic raises controversial issues. \emph{Concise:} It should only contain the
% most important results. It should not exceed 300--500 words or about one page.
% \emph{Intelligible:} It should only contain widely-used terms. It should
% not contain equations and citations. Try to avoid symbols and acronyms (or at
% least explain them). \emph{Informative:} The reader should be able to quickly
% evaluate, whether or not the thesis is relevant for his/her work.

% An Example: The objective was to determine whether \dots (\emph{question/goal}).
% For this purpose, \dots was \dots (\emph{methodology}). It was found that \dots
% (\emph{results}). The results demonstrate that \dots (\emph{answer}).

Global glacier models are imperative to project future glacier ice mass loss and the accompanied sea level rise. Glaciers are controlled by their mass balance and the resulting ice flow. Hence, a glacier model has to incorporate a mass balance model, to account for accumulation and ablation, and a dynamic model, to update glacier geometries in response to mass balance changes. The scarcity of ice volume observations makes the calibration, and especially validation, of geometry models difficult. As a consequence, most global model use \vas{} relations instead of a dedicated ice physic model.
Over the last years, the increasing accuracy and coverage of global data inventories, in combination with new and automated methods, allowed for the development of more sophisticated models. This study compares a global glacier model based on scaling relations \citep{Marzeion2012b} to a globally applicable flowline model based on the Shallow Ice Approximation \citep{Maussion2019}.
While the \vas{} model produces qualitatively comparable results, absolute values and relative changes in ice volume are drastically underestimated when compared to the flowline model. This can partially be attributed to a missing mass-balance-elevation feedback and the overestimation of model-internal time scales. Additionally, these too long time scales result in oscillating adjustments of glacier geometries to step changes in climate. The response to natural climate variabilities is in alignment with theoretical expectations, but absolute changes are again underestimated. Even though the model accuracies are not assessed, the usage of more complex models is advisable for future projections of glacier mass changes on a regional and global scale.
