	Abstract = {Abstract. We present a minimal model of the glacier surface mass balance. The model relies solely on monthly precipitation and air temperatures as forcing. We first train the model individually for 15 glaciers with existing mass balance measurements. Based on a cross validation, we present a thorough assessment of the models performance outside of the training period. The cross validation indicates that our model is robust, and our models performance compares favorably to that from a less parsimonious model based on seasonal sensitivity characteristics. Then, the model is extended for application on glaciers without existing mass balance measurements. We cross validated the model again by withholding the mass balance information from each of the 15 glaciers above during the model training, in order to measure its performance on glaciers not included in the model training. This cross validation indicates that the model retains considerable skill even when applied on glaciers without mass balance measurements. As an exemplary application, the model is then used to reconstruct time series of interannual mass balance variability, covering the past two hundred years, for all glaciers in the European Alps contained in the extended format of the world glacier inventory. Based on this reconstruction, we present a spatially detailed attribution of the glaciers mass balance variability to temperature and precipitation variability},

	Abstract = {Glaciers offer the potential to reconstruct past climate over timescales from decades to millennia. They are found on nearly every continent, and at the Last Glacial Maximum, glaciers were larger in all regions on Earth. The physics of glacier-climate interaction are relatively well understood, and glacier models can be used to reconstruct past climate from geological evidence of past glacier extent. This can lead to significant insights regarding past, present, and future climate. For example, glacier modeling has demonstrated that the near ubiquitous global pattern of glacier retreat during the last few centuries resulted from a global-scale climate warming of ∼1$\,^{\circ}$C, consistent with instrumental data and climate proxy records. Climate reconstructions from glaciers have also demonstrated that the tropics were colder at the Last Glacial Maximum than was originally inferred from sea surface temperature reconstructions. Future efforts to reconstruct climate from glaciers may provide new constraints on climat...},

A detailed uncertainty analysis takes into account glacier geometry, model parameters and initial conditions. A Monte Carlo ensemble strengthens the result that the observed retreat cannot be explained by natural variability and therefore affirms regional climate change. Finally the observed temperature trend at Hintereisferner lies outside the range of natural variability from an ensemble of climate models, but is consistent with the modeled range of responses to anthropogenic forcing.},

	Abstract = {Shrinking glaciers are an iconic impact of past and ongoing climate change. Since glaciers ad- just slowly to a changing climate, there is an imbalance between the current climate and their geometry: Present and future glacier extent largely depends on past climate variability, turning glaciers into a "delayed" sensor of climate change. A measure that is often used to describe how fast glaciers react to climate change (here defined as a step change in temperature, ∆T) is the e-folding response time, i.e the time in which 63{\%} of the adjustment between an initial and a perturbed equilibrium glacier state occurs. Estimating this response time from known glacier characteristics would be very useful, but this is impeded by the complex non-linear response of glacier dynamics to climate perturbations. Therefore, we rely on a numerical model to attempt to disentangle the factors affecting the e-folding response time. Using the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM), we perform idealised glacier experiments to estimate the response time sensitivity to climatic or geometric glacier characteristics. Start- ing with idealised glacier geometries, the experiments are improved to include more realistic and complex bed geometries. We compute the temporal evolution (1862--2003) of the response time of the Hintereisferner, {\"{O}}tztal Alps, using initial equilibrium glacier states with similar lengths as the observations and the HISTALP climate dataset. Furthermore, we conduct general response time estimates for 3863 alpine glaciers using initial equilibrium glaciers with similar areas as mea- sured in 2003. For a large temperature perturbation ∆T, the response time of the Hintereisferner decreases over time along with decreasing glacier length. For smaller ∆T, the response time is longer, com- mencing with a slight increase and then followed by a decrease. This initial paradoxical increase is most likely due to melting of the glacier into a bedrock depression. For idealised glaciers of con- stant width and a single flowline, we could attribute increased response times to such a bedrock depression. The response time of alpine glaciers for smaller ∆T is more variable between the glaciers and mostly longer, for ∆T=+0.1◦C in median 53 years and 50{\%} of the glaciers between 42 and 121 years compared to for ∆T=+1◦C in median 20 years and 50{\%} between 14 and 29 years. Moreover, the response time is shorter for steeper glaciers or higher mass balance gradi- ents for alpine glaciers as well as in idealised experiments. For large ∆T=+1◦C, the response time appears to increase linearly with the mean ice thickness. Glacier size parameters such as volume, area or length do not have a direct influence on the response time of alpine glaciers. Most alpine glaciers are steeper in their upper part, which might explain why applying larger ∆T results in rather shorter response times. This effect is most prominent for flat initial equilibrium glaciers, possibly because the response time is more sensitive to perturbed equilibrium slope changes on flat glaciers compared to already relatively steep glaciers. Besides the large response time sen- sitivity on the applied perturbation ∆T, we find discrepancies between different model set-ups and studies. Therefore, we conclude that the response time is only a relative measure under simplified "laboratory conditions", and its interpretation as an absolute number is delicate. Despite the vagueness of its definition, it is a simple tool to compare the glaciers' response to climatic change and to diagnose which geometric and climatic parameters control the response behaviour. Fur- thermore, the response time and its changes with ∆T could be used to cluster worldwide glaciers into specific groups of response time, and these insights could improve calibrations of numerical global glacier models. Whether the response time has a predictive value for other aspects of glaciology such as the current rate of volume change has to be studied in the future.},

@article{Huss2014,
	Abstract = {Glacier response to a changing climate and its impact on runoff is understood in general terms, but model-based projections are affected by considerable uncertainties. They originate from the driving climate model, input data quality, and simplifications in the glacio-hydrological model and hamper the reliability of the simulations. Here, an integrative assessment of the uncertainty in 21st century glacier runoff is provided based on experiments using the Glacier Evolution Runoff Model (GERM) applied to the catchment of Findelengletscher, Switzerland. GERM is calibrated and validated in a multi-objective approach and is run using nine Regional Climate Models (RCMs) until 2100. Among others, the hydrological impacts of the RCM downscaling procedure, the winter snow accumulation, the surface albedo and the calculation of ice melt and glacier retreat are investigated. All experiments indicate rapid glacier wastage and a transient runoff increase followed by reduced melt season discharge. However, major uncertainties in, e.g., glacier area loss (-100{\%} to -63{\%}) and the change in annual runoff (-57{\%} to +25{\%} relative to today) by 2100 are found. The impact of model assumptions on changes in August runoff is even higher (-94{\%} to -5{\%}). The spread in RCM results accounts for 20-50{\%} of the overall uncertainty in modeled discharge. Initial ice thickness, the amount and spatial distribution of winter snow and the glacier retreat model have the largest effect on the projections, whereas the RCM downscaling procedure, calibration data quality and the melt model (energy balance vs. degree-day approach) are of secondary importance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Slangen2011,
	Abstract = {A large part of present-day sea-level change is formed by the melt of glaciers and ice caps (GIC). This study focuses on the uncertainties in the calculation of the GIC contribution on a century timescale. The model used is based on volume-area scaling, combined with the mass balance sensitivity of the GIC. We assess different aspects that contribute to the uncertainty in the prediction of the contribution of GIC to future sea-level rise, such as (1) the volume-area scaling method (scaling factor), (2) the glacier data, (3) the climate models, and (4) the emission scenario. Additionally, a comparison of the model results to the 20th century GIC contribution is presented. We find that small variations in the scaling factor cause significant variations in the initial volume of the glaciers, but only limited variations in the glacier volume change. If two existing glacier inventories are tuned such that the initial volume is the same, the GIC sea-level contribution over 100 yr differs by 0.027 m or 18 {\%}. It appears that the mass balance sensitivity is also important: variations of 20 {\%} in the mass balance sensitivity have an impact of 17 {\%} on the resulting sea-level projections. Another important factor is the choice of the climate model, as the GIC contribution to sea-level change largely depends on the temperature and precipitation taken from climate models. Connected to this is the choice of emission scenario, used to drive the climate models. Combining all the uncertainties examined in this study leads to a total uncertainty of 0.052 m or 35 {\%} in the GIC contribution to global mean sea level. Reducing the variance in the climate models and improving the glacier inventories will significantly reduce the uncertainty in calculating the GIC contributions, and are therefore crucial actions to improve future sea-level projections. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2011.},

Its aim is to study the theoretical aspects of'ice mechanics' and the 'dynamics of ice masses in a geophysical environment. For the mature reader, the book can serve as an introduction to glaciology. How- ever, this is not what I would regard as advisible. Glaciology is an inter- disciplinary science in which many special scientific disciplines play their part, from descriptive geography to fairly abstract mathematics. Advance- ment will evolve from a merger of two or more branches of scientific specialization. In the last 20 years, several researchers in different fields of glaciology have written books emphasizing the aspects of their specialities and I have listed some which are known to me at the end of the Introduction. When glancing through these books, one recognizes that the mathematical aspects of glaciology are generally glossed over and, to date, there seems to be nothing available which concentrates on these. Therefore, I have written this book in an effort to close the gap and no apologies are offered for the mathematical emphasis. Rather, I believe that this neglect has, to a certain extent, aggra- vated progress in the modelling of glaciology problems.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the HISTALP database, consisting of monthly homogenised records of temperature, pressure,
precipitation, sunshine and cloudiness for the `Greater Alpine Region' (GAR, 4--19 $\,^{\circ}$E, 43--49 $\,^{\circ}$N, 0--3500m asl). The
longest temperature and air pressure series extend back to 1760, precipitation to 1800, cloudiness to the 1840s and sunshine
to the 1880s. A systematic QC procedure has been applied to the series and a high number of inhomogeneities (more
than 2500) and outliers (more than 5000) have been detected and removed. The 557 HISTALP series are kept in different
data modes: original and homogenised, gap-filled and outlier corrected station mode series, grid-1 series (anomaly fields
at 1$\,^{\circ}$ × 1$\,^{\circ}$, lat × long) and Coarse Resolution Subregional (CRS) mean series according to an EOF-based regionalisation.
The leading climate variability features within the GAR are discussed through selected examples and a concluding linear
trend analysis for 100, 50 and 25-year subperiods for the four horizontal and two altitudinal CRSs. Among the key findings
of the trend analysis is the parallel centennial decrease/increase of both temperature and air pressure in the 19th/20th
century. The 20th century increase (+1.2 $\,^{\circ}$C/+1.1 hPa for annual GAR-means) evolved stepwise with a first peak near
1950 and the second increase (1.3 $\,^{\circ}$C/0.6hPa per 25 years) starting in the 1970s. Centennial and decadal scale temperature
trends were identical for all subregions. Air pressure, sunshine and cloudiness show significant differences between low
versus high elevations. A long-term increase of the high-elevation series relative to the low-elevation series is given for
sunshine and air pressure. Of special interest is the exceptional high correlation near 0.9 between the series on mean
temperature and air pressure difference (high-minus low-elevation). This, further developed via some atmospheric statics
and thermodynamics, allows the creation of `barometric temperature series' without use of the measures of temperature.
They support the measured temperature trends in the region. Precipitation shows the most significant regional and seasonal
differences with, e.g., remarkable opposite 20th century evolution for NW (9{\%} increase) versus SE (9{\%} decrease). Other
long- and short-term features are discussed and indicate the promising potential of the new database for further analyses
and applications.},

@article{Roe2009,
	Abstract = {Discriminating between glacier variations due to natural climate variability and those due to true climate change is crucial for the interpretation and attribution of past glacier changes, and for the expectations of future changes. We explore this issue for the well-documented glaciers of Mount Baker in the Cascades Mountains of Washington State, USA, using glacier histories, glacier modeling, weather data and numerical weather model output. We find that natural variability alone is capable of producing kilometer-scale excursions in glacier length on multi-decadal and centennial timescales. Such changes are similar in magnitude to those attributed to a global Little Ice Age. The null hypothesis, that no climate change is required to explain the glacier fluctuations in this setting, cannot be rejected. These results for Mount Baker glaciers are also consistent with an earlier study analyzing individual glaciers in Scandinavia and the Alps. The principle that long-timescale fluctuations of glacier length can e driven by short-timescale fluctuations in climate reflects a robust and fundamental property of stochastically forced physical systems with memory. It is very likely that this principle also applies to other Alpine glaciers and that it therefore complicates interpretations of the relationship between glacier and climate history. However, the amplitude and timescale of the length fluctuations depends on the details of the particular glacier geometry and climatic setting, and this remains largely unevaluated for most glaciers.},

Through numerical simulations of 3D, high-order glacier mechanics, we demonstrate how different topographic and climatic settings, glacier flow dynamics, and the degree of disequilibrium with climate systematically affect the volume-area relation. We recommend more accurate scaling relations through characterization of individual glacier shape, slope and size. An ensemble of 280 randomly-generated valley glaciers spanning a spectrum of plausible glaciological conditions yields a steady-state exponent = 1.46. This declines to 1.38 for glaciers that are 100years into a sustained retreat, which corresponds exceptionally well with the observed value for present-day glaciers. {\textcopyright} 2012.

	Abstract = {Global warming is expected to significantly affect the runoff regime of mountainous catchments. Simple methods for calculating future glacier change in hydrological models are required in order to reliably assess economic impacts of changes in the water cycle over the next decades. Models for temporal and spatial glacier evolution need to describe the climate forcing acting on the glacier, and ice flow dynamics. Flow models, however, demand considerable computational resources and field data input and are moreover not applicable on the regional scale. Here, we propose a simple parameterization for calculating the change in glacier surface elevation and area, which is mass conserving and suited for hydrological modelling. The $\alpha$h-parameterization is an empirical glacier-specific function derived from observations in the past that can easily be applied to large samples of glaciers. We compare the $\alpha$h- parameterization to results of a 3-D finite-element ice flow model. As case studies, the evolution of two Alpine glaciers of different size over the period 2008-2100 is investigated using regional climate scenarios. The parameterization closely reproduces the distributed ice thickness change, as well as glacier area and length predicted by the ice flow model. This indicates that for the purpose of transient runoff forecasts, future glacier geometry change can be approximated using a simple parameterization instead of complex ice flow modelling. Furthermore, we analyse alpine glacier response to 21st century climate change and consequent shifts in the runoff regime of a highly glacierized catchment using the proposed methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Author(s).},

	Abstract = {The length of time TM over which a glacier responds to a prior change in climate is investigated with reference to the linearized theory of kinematic waves and to results from numerical models. We show the following: TM may in general be estimated by a volume time-scale describing the time required for a step change in mass balance to supply the volume difference between the initial and final steady states. The factor f in the classical estimate of TM = fl/u, where l is glacier length and u is terminus velocity, has a simple geometrical interpretation . It is the ratio of thickness change averaged over the full length l to the change at the terminus. Although both u and f relate to dynamic processes local to the terminus zone, the ratio f/u and, therefore, TM are insensitive to details of the terminus dynamics , in contrast to conclusions derived from some simplified kinematic wave models. A more robust estimate of TM independent of terminus dynamics is given by TM = h/(-b) where h is a thickness scale for the glacier and -b is the mass-balance rate (negative) at the terminus. We suggest that TM for mountain glaciers can be substantially less than the 10{\^{}}2-10{\^{}}3 years commonly considered to be theoretically expected.},

	Abstract = {Mass loss by glaciers has been an important contributor to sea level rise in the past, and is projected to contribute a substantial fraction of total sea level rise during the 21st century. Here, we use a model of the world's glaciers to quantify equilibrium sensitivities of global glacier mass to climate change, and to investigate the role of changes in glacier hypsometry for long-term mass changes. We find that 21st century glacier-mass loss is largely governed by the glacier's response to 20th century climate change. This limits the influence of 21st century climate change on glacier-mass loss, and explains why there are relatively small differences in glacier-mass loss under greatly different scenarios of climate change. The projected future changes in both temperature and precipitation experienced by glaciers are amplified relative to the global average. The projected increase in precipitation partly compensates for the mass loss caused by warming, but this compensation is negligible at higher temperature anomalies since an increasing fraction of precipitation at the glacier sites is liquid. Loss of low-lying glacier area, and more importantly, eventual complete disappearance of glaciers, strongly limit the projected sea level contribution from glaciers in coming centuries. The adjustment of glacier hypsometry to changes in the forcing strongly reduces the rates of global glacier-mass loss caused by changes in global mean temperature compared to rates of mass loss when hypsometric changes are neglected. This result is a second reason for the relatively weak dependence of glacier-mass loss on future climate scenario, and helps explain why glacier-mass loss in the first half of the 20th century was of the same order of magnitude as in the second half of the 20th century, even though the rate of warming was considerably smaller. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

	Abstract = {Volume--area scaling is a common tool for deriving future volume evolutions of valley glaciers and their contribution to sea-level rise. We analyze the performance of scaling relationships for deriving volume projections in comparison to projections from a one-dimensional ice-flow model. The model is calibrated for six glaciers (Nigardsbreen, Rhonegletscher, South Cascade Glacier, Sofiyskiy glacier, midre Love´nbreen and Abramov glacier). Volume evolutions forced by different hypothetical mass-balance perturbations are compared with those obtained from volume--area (V-A), volume--length (V-L) and volume--area--length (V-A-L) scaling. Results show that the scaling methods mostly underestimate the volume losses predicted by the ice-flow model, up to 47{\%} for V-A scaling and up to 18{\%} for V-L scaling by the end of the 100 year simulation period. In general, V-L scaling produces closer simulations of volume evolutions derived from the ice-flow model, suggesting that V-L scaling may be a better approach for deriving volume projections than V-A scaling. Sensitivity experiments show that the initial volumes and volume evolutions are highly sensitive to the choice of the scaling constants, yielding both over- and underestimates. However, when normalized by initial volume, volume evolutions are relatively insensitive to the choice of scaling constants, especially in the V-L scaling. The 100 year volume projections differ within 10{\%} of initial volume when the V-A scaling exponent commonly assumed, ? ¼ 1.375, is varied by --30{\%} to +45{\%} (? ¼ [0.95, 2.00]) and the V-L scaling exponent, q ¼ 2.2, is varied by --30{\%} to +45{\%} (q ¼ [1.52, 3.20]). This is encouraging for the use of scaling methods in glacier volume projections, particularly since scaling exponents may vary between glaciers and the scaling constants are generally unknown.},

This is in contrast to most previous analyses which implicitly of explicitly assumed scaling exponents of either 0 or 1. The exponent 0.6 implies that average glacier widths are proportional to average glacier thicknesses.

	Abstract = {Sea-level change (SLC) is a much-studied topic in the area of climate research, integrating a range of climate science disciplines, and is expected to impact coastal communities around the world. As a result, this field is rapidly moving, and the knowledge and understanding of processes contributing to SLC is increasing. Here, we discuss noteworthy recent developments in the projection of SLC contributions and in the global mean and regional sea-level projections. For the Greenland Ice Sheet contribution to SLC, earlier estimates have been confirmed in recent research, but part of the source of this contribution has shifted from dynamics to surface melting. New insights into dynamic discharge processes and the onset of marine ice sheet instability increase the projected range for the Antarctic contribution by the end of the century. The contribution from both ice sheets is projected to increase further in the coming centuries to millennia. Recent updates of the global glacier outline database and new global glacier models have led to slightly lower projections for the glacier contribution to SLC (7--17 cm by 2100), but still project the glaciers to be an important contribution. For global mean sea-level projections, the focus has shifted to better estimating the uncertainty distributions of the projection time series, which may not necessarily follow a normal distribution. Instead, recent studies use skewed distributions with longer tails to higher uncertainties. Regional projections have been used to study regional uncertainty distributions, and regional projections are increasingly being applied to specific regions, countries, and coastal areas.},

We find that 21st century glacier-mass loss is largely governed by the glacier's response to 20th century climate change. This limits the influence of 21st century climate change on glacier-mass loss, and explains why there are relatively small differences in glacier-mass loss under greatly different scenarios of climate change.

	Abstract = {To study the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers, velocities at the bed of a glacier must be measured directly or calculated using data gathered from boreholes and surface surveys. Boreholes to the bed are expensive and time-consuming to drill, so the determination of basal velocity is almost exclusively by numerical inversion of velocities observed at the surface. For non-linearly viscous glaciers, a perturbation analysis demonstrates that inversions for englacial velocities will magnify measurement errors at an exponential rate with depth. The rate at which calculation errors grow is proportional to a Lyapunov exponent, a measure of "information loss' which is shown to be a simple linear function of spatial frequency with a coefficient depending on Glen's flow-law exponent, n. This limitation is theoretical and cannot be countered by more accurate survey data or special numerical techniques. -from Authors},

We present a statistical method for deriving regional and global ice volumes from regional glacier area distributions and volume area scaling using glacier area data from ∼ 123,000 glaciers from a recently extended World Glacier Inventory. We compute glacier volumes and their sea level equivalent (SLE) for 19 glacierized regions containing all mountain glaciers and ice caps on Earth. On the basis of total glacierized area of 741 x 103 $\pm$ 68 x 10 km2, we estimate a total ice volume of 241 x 103 $\pm$ 29 x 10 3 km3, corresponding to 0.60 $\pm$ 0.07 m SLE, of which 32{\%} is due to glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica apart from the ice sheets. However, our estimate is sensitive to assumptions on volume area scaling coefficients and glacier area distributions in the regions that are poorly inventoried, i.e., Antarctica, North America, Greenland, and Patagonia. This emphasizes the need for more volume observations, especially of large glaciers and a more complete World Glacier Inventory in order to reduce uncertainties and to arrive at firmer volume estimates for all mountain glaciers and ice caps.

	Abstract = {The transient response of glaciers to climate variations is investigated with a novel low-order model of an idealized glacier resting on uniformly inclined bedrock. The model consists of two volumes representing the accumulation and ablation areas, which are joined by a flux gate controlling mass flow according to the shallow-ice approximation. Under the assumption of a constant vertical mass-balance gradient, a volume-length scaling relation is derived which depends explicitly on mass-balance gradient and bedrock slope. Analytic expressions for the volume and area timescales are given, which are inversely proportional to the mass-balance gradient and a geometric factor which is the ratio between the vertical extent of the ablation area and the ice thickness at the equilibrium line. From the low-order model, a dynamical system in length and volume is obtained. Results from this system are in good agreement with solutions obtained from a transient finite-element model solving the full force-balance and mass-conservation equations. Under periodic forcing there are significant deviations of the length response, which show that the usual relaxation-type parameterization of length change is not well suited for short-term reactions. Switching on and off periodic climate forcing, the model glaciers show surprisingly large initial and final transient responses that have not been investigated before. These results are of significance for the interpretation of length and thickness changes observed on glaciers.},

	Abstract = {In order to understand the fundamental parameters governing glacier advance and retreat, and also the spectral properties of fluctuations in glacier length in response to noisy weather, we examine outputs of a numerical flowline model solving the shallow-ice equations with sliding. The numerical results reveal a surprising simplicity: the time evolution and spectral shape of glacier excursions depend on a single parameter, a time constant determined by the geometrical properties of the glacier. Furthermore, the numerical results reveal that perturbations in mass balance over the glacier surface set in motion a sequence of events that can be roughly described as occurring in three overlapping stages: (1) changes in interior thickness drive (2) changes in terminus flux, which in turn drive (3) changes in glacier length. A simple, third-order linear differential equation, which extends previous models in the literature, successfully captures these important features of the glacier flow. This three-stage linear model is readily invertible to recover climate history. It provides clear physical insight and analytical expressions for some important metrics of glacier behavior, such as variance, sensitivity and excursion probabilities. Finally, it facilitates uncertainty analysis. The linear model can also be adapted for arbitrary catchment geometry, and is applied to Nigardsbreen, Norway.},

	Abstract = {Estimating a glacier's volume by inferring properties at depth (e.g. bed topography or basal slip) from properties observed at the surface (e.g. area and slope) creates a calculation instability that grows exponentially with the size of the glacier. Random errors from this inversion instability can overwhelm all other sources of error and can corrupt thickness and volume calculations, unless problematic short spatial wavelengths are specifically excluded. Volume/area scaling inherently filters these short wavelengths and automatically eliminates the instability, while numerical inversions can also give stable solutions by filtering the correct wavelengths explicitly, as is frequently done when 'regularizing' a model. Each of the scaling and numerical techniques has applications to which it is better suited, and there are trade-offs in resolution and accuracy; but when calculating volume, neither the modeling nor the scaling approach offers a fundamental advantage over the other. Both are significantly limited by the inherently 'ill-posed' inversion, and even though both provide stable volume solutions, neither can give unique solutions.},

	Abstract = {Volume-area scaling is the most popular method for estimating the ice volume of large glacier samples. Here, a series of resampling experiments based on different sets of synthetic data is presented in order to derive an upper-bound estimate (i.e. a level achieved only within ideal conditions) for its accuracy. For real-world applications, a lower accuracy has to be expected. We also quantify the maximum accuracy expected when scaling is used for determining the glacier volume change, and area change of a given glacier population. A comprehensive set of measured glacier areas, volumes, area and volume changes is evaluated to investigate the impact of real-world data quality on the so-assessed accuracies. For populations larger than a few thousand glaciers, the total ice volume can be recovered within 30{\%} if all data currently available worldwide are used for estimating the scaling parameters. Assuming no systematic bias in ice volume measurements, their uncertainty is of secondary importance. Knowing the individual areas of a glacier sample for two points in time allows recovering the corresponding ice volume change within 40{\%} for populations larger than a few hundred glaciers, both for steady-state and transient geometries. If ice volume changes can be estimated without bias, glacier area changes derived from volume-area scaling show similar uncertainties to those of the volume changes. This paper does not aim at making a final judgement on the suitability of volume-area scaling as such, but provides the means for assessing the accuracy expected from its application. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

	Abstract = {An empirical formula relating volume of an Alpine glacier to the surface area is improved based on the data measured by radio-echo sounding and seismic method. The ice-covered area of the Alpine glaciers was 4369$\pm$54km2 in the 1870s, 3541$\pm$33km2 in the 1930s, and 2909km2 in the 1970s. For the period 1870s-1970s, the volume of Alpine glaciers decreased by 57.4$\pm$20.4km3 with the volume in the 1970s being 140$\pm$10km3. The mean rate of changes over this period is about -15km2/a for the ice-covered area, -0.574km3/a for the volume and -0.163m/a for the mean thickness. The mass-turnover time of an Alpine glacier, which is important in investigating the water cycle of a basin with glaciers, is estimated to be in the order of 101-102a. -from Authors},

	Abstract = {Sound knowledge of the ice volume and ice-thickness distribution of a glacier is essential for many glaciological applications. However, direct measurements of ice thickness are laborious, not feasible everywhere and necessarily restricted to a small number of glaciers. In this paper, we present a method to estimate the ice-thickness distribution and the total ice volume of alpine glaciers. This method is based on glacier mass turnover and principles of ice-flow mechanics. The required input data are the glacier surface topography, the glacier outline and a set of borders delineating different 'ice-flow catchments'. Three parameters describe the distribution of the 'apparent mass balance', which is defined as the difference between the glacier surface mass balance and the rate of ice-thickness change, and two parameters define the ice-flow dynamics. The method was developed and validated on four alpine glaciers located in Switzerland, for which the bedrock topography is partially known from radio-echo soundings. The ice thickness along 82 cross-profiles can be reproduced with an average deviation of about 25{\%} between the calculated and the measured ice thickness. The cross-sectional areas differ by less than 20{\%} on average. This shows the potential of the method for estimating the ice-thickness distribution of alpine glaciers without the use of direct measurements.},

	Abstract = {Volume-area scaling provides a practical alternative to ice-flow modelling to account for glacier size changes when modelling the future evolution of glaciers; however, uncertainties remain as to the validity of this approach under non-steady conditions. We address these uncertainties by deriving scaling exponents in the volume-area relationship from one-dimensional ice-flow modelling. We generate a set of 37 synthetic steady-state glaciers of different sizes, and then model their volume evolution due to climate warming and cooling as prescribed by negative and positive mass-balance perturbations, respectively, on a century timescale. The scaling exponent derived for the steady-state glaciers ($\gamma$ = 1.56) differs from the exponents derived for the glaciers in transient (non-steady) state by up to 86{\%}. Nevertheless, volume projections employing volume-area scaling are relatively insensitive to these differences in scaling exponents. Volume-area scaling agrees well with the results from ice-flow modelling. In addition, the scaling method is able to simulate the approach of a glacier to a new steady state, if mass-balance elevation feedback is approximated by removing or adding elevation bands at the lowest part of the glacier as the glacier retreats or advances. If area changes are approximated in the mass-balance computations in this way, our results indicate that volume-area scaling is a powerful tool for glacier volume projections on multi-century timescales.},

	Abstract = {Ice volumes are known for only a few of the roughly 160,000 glaciers worldwide but are important components of many climate and sea level studies which require water flux estimates. A scaling analysis of the mass and momentum conservation equations shows that glacier volumes can be related by a power law to more easily observed glacier surface areas. The relationship requires four closure choices for the scaling behavior of glacier widths, slopes, side drag and mass balance. Reasonable closures predict a volume-area scaling exponent which is consistent with observations, giving a physical and practical basis for estimating ice volumes. Glacier volume is insensitive to perturbations in the mass balance scaling, but changes in average accumulation area ratios reflect significant changes in the scaling of both mass balance and ice volume.},

	Abstract = {Sea-level change is often considered to be globally uniform in sea-level projections. However, local relative sea-level (RSL) change can deviate substantially from the global mean. Here, we present maps of twenty-first century local RSL change estimates based on an ensemble of coupled climate model simulations for three emission scenarios. In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4), the same model simulations were used for their projections of global mean sea-level rise. The contribution of the small glaciers and ice caps to local RSL change is calculated with a glacier model, based on a volume-area approach. The contributions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are obtained from IPCC AR4 estimates. The RSL distribution resulting from the land ice mass changes is then calculated by solving the sea-level equation for a rotating, elastic Earth model. Next, we add the pattern of steric RSL changes obtained from the coupled climate models and a model estimate for the effect of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment. The resulting ensemble mean RSL pattern reveals that many regions will experience RSL changes that differ substantially from the global mean. For the A1B ensemble, local RSL change values range from -3.91 to 0.79 m, with a global mean of 0.47 m. Although the RSL amplitude differs, the spatial patterns are similar for all three emission scenarios. The spread in the projections is dominated by the distribution of the steric contribution, at least for the processes included in this study. Extreme ice loss scenarios may alter this picture. For individual sites, we find a standard deviation for the combined contributions of approximately 10 cm, regardless of emission scenario. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

Projections vary considerably between regions, and also among the glacier models. Global glacier mass changes per degree global air temperature rise tend to increase with more pronounced warming indicating that mass-balance sensitivities to temperature change are not constant. Differences in glacier mass projections among the models are attributed to differences in model physics, calibration and downscaling procedures, initial ice volumes and varying ensembles of forcing GCMs.},

	Abstract = {The large uncertainty in future global glacier volume projections partly results from a substantial range in future climate conditions projected by global climate models. This study addresses the effect of global and regional differences in climate input data on the projected twenty-first century glacier contribution to sea-level rise. Glacier volume changes are calculated with a surface mass balance model combined with volume-area scaling, applied to 89 glaciers in different climatic regions. The mass balance model is based on a simplified energy balance approach, with separated contributions by net solar radiation and the combined other fluxes. Future mass balance is calculated from anomalies in air temperature, precipitation and atmospheric transmissivity, taken from eight global climate models forced with the A1B emission scenario. Regional and global sea-level contributions are obtained by scaling the volume changes at the modelled glaciers to all glaciers larger than 0.1 km2 outside the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. This results in a global value of 0.102 $\pm$ 0.028 m (multi-model mean and standard deviation) relative sea-level equivalent for the period 2012-2099, corresponding to 18 $\pm$ 5 {\%} of the estimated total volume of glaciers. Glaciers in the Antarctic, Alaska, Central Asia and Greenland together account for 65 $\pm$ 4 {\%} of the total multi-model mean projected sea-level rise. The projected sea-level contribution is 35 $\pm$ 17 {\%} larger when only anomalies in air temperature are taken into account, demonstrating an important compensating effect by increased precipitation and possibly reduced atmospheric transmissivity. The variability in projected precipitation and atmospheric transmissivity changes is especially large in the Arctic regions, making the sea-level contribution for these regions particularly sensitive to the climate model used. Including additional uncertainties in the modelling procedure and the input data, the total uncertainty estimate for the future projections becomes $\pm$0.063 m. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We present an ensemble of 288 glacier mass and area change projections for the 21st century based on 11 glacier models using up to 10 general circulation models and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) as boundary conditions. We partition the total uncertainty into the individual contributions caused by glacier models, general circulation models, RCPs, and natural variability. We find that emission scenario uncertainty is growing throughout the 21st century and is the largest source of uncertainty by 2100. The relative importance of glacier model uncertainty decreases over time, but it is the greatest source of uncertainty until the middle of this century. The projection uncertainty associated with natural variability is small on the global scale but can be large on regional scales.

	Abstract = {Predicting shallow landslide size and location across landscapes is important for understanding landscape form and evolution and for hazard identification. We test a recently developed model that couples a search algorithm with 3-D slope stability analysis that predicts these two key attributes in an intensively studied landscape with a 10 year landslide inventory. We use process-based submodels to estimate soil depth, root strength, and pore pressure for a sequence of landslide-triggering rainstorms. We parameterize submodels with field measurements independently of the slope stability model, without calibrating predictions to observations. The model generally reproduces observed landslide size and location distributions, overlaps 65{\%} of observed landslides, and of these predicts size to within factors of 2 and 1.5 in 55{\%} and 28{\%} of cases, respectively. Five percent of the landscape is predicted unstable, compared to 2{\%} recorded landslide area. Missed landslides are not due to the search algorithm but to the formulation and parameterization of the slope stability model and inaccuracy of observed landslide maps. Our model does not improve location prediction relative to infinite-slope methods but predicts landslide size, improves process representation, and reduces reliance on effective parameters. Increasing rainfall intensity or root cohesion generally increases landslide size and shifts locations down hollow axes, while increasing cohesion restricts unstable locations to areas with deepest soils. Our findings suggest that shallow landslide abundance, location, and size are ultimately controlled by covarying topographic, material, and hydrologic properties. Estimating the spatiotemporal patterns of root strength, pore pressure, and soil depth across a landscapemay be the greatest remaining challenge.},

	Abstract = {Glaciers in the European Alps rapidly lose mass to adapt to changes in climate conditions. Here, we investigate the relationship and lag between climate forcing and geometric glacier response with a regional glacier evolution model accounting for ice dynamics. The volume loss occurring as a result of the glacier-climate imbalance increased over the early 21st century, from about 35{\%} in 2001 to 44{\%} in 2010. This committed loss reduced to {\~{}}40{\%} by 2018, indicating that temperature increase was outweighing glacier retreat in the early 2000s but that the fast retreat effectively somewhat diminished glacier imbalances. We analyze the lag in glacier response for each individual glacier and find mean response times of 50 $\pm$ 28 years. Our findings indicate that the response time is primarily controlled by glacier slope and secondarily by elevation range and mass balance gradient, rather than by glacier size.},

	Abstract = {A large component of present-day sea-level rise is due to the melt of glaciers other than the ice sheets. Recent projections of their contribution to global sea-level rise for the twenty-first century range between 70 and 180 mm, but bear significant uncertainty due to poor glacier inventory and lack of hypsometric data. Here, we aim to update the projections and improve quantification of their uncertainties by using a recently released global inventory containing outlines of almost every glacier in the world. We model volume change for each glacier in response to transient spatially-differentiated temperature and precipitation projections from 14 global climate models with two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) prepared for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The multi-model mean suggests sea-level rise of 155 $\pm$ 41 mm (RCP4.5) and 216 $\pm$ 44 mm (RCP8.5) over the period 2006-2100, reducing the current global glacier volume by 29 or 41 {\%}. The largest contributors to projected global volume loss are the glaciers in the Canadian and Russian Arctic, Alaska, and glaciers peripheral to the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Although small contributors to global volume loss, glaciers in Central Europe, low-latitude South America, Caucasus, North Asia, and Western Canada and US are projected to lose more than 80 {\%} of their volume by 2100. However, large uncertainties in the projections remain due to the choice of global climate model and emission scenario. With a series of sensitivity tests we quantify additional uncertainties due to the calibration of our model with sparsely observed glacier mass changes. This gives an upper bound for the uncertainty range of $\pm$84 mm sea-level rise by 2100 for each projection. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

They are expected to remain an important component of eustatic sea-level rise for at least another century1,2, despite indications of accelerated wastage of the ice sheets3-5. However, it is difficult to project the future contribution of these small-scale glaciers to sea-level rise on a global scale. Here, we project their volume changes due to melt in response to transient, spatially differentiated twenty-first century projections of temperature and precipitation from ten global climate models. We conduct the simulations directly on the more than 120,000 glaciers now available in the World Glacier Inventory6, and upscale the changes to 19 regions that contain all mountain glaciers and ice caps in the world (excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets). According to our multi-model mean, sea-level rise from glacier wastage by 2100 will amount to 0.124 $\pm$ 0.037 m, with the largest contribution from glaciers in Arctic Canada, Alaska and Antarctica. Total glacier volume will be reduced by 21 $\pm$ 6{\%}, but some regions are projected to lose up to 75{\%} of their present ice volume.

Such projections of sea level change depend on estimated future greenhouse emissions and on differing models, but model-average results from a mid-range scenario (A1B) suggests a 0.387-m rise by 2100 (refs 1, 2). The largest contributions to sea level rise are estimated to come from thermal expansion (0.288 m) and the melting of mountain glaciers and icecaps (0.106 m), with smaller inputs from Greenland (0.024 m) and Antarctica (-0.074 m)1. Here we apply a melt model3 and a geometric volume model4 to our lower estimate of ice volume5-7 and assess the contribution of glaciers to sea level rise, excluding those in Greenland and Antarctica. We provide the first separate assessment of melt contributions from mountain glaciers and icecaps, as well as an improved treatment of volume shrinkage. We find that icecaps melt more slowly than mountain glaciers, whose area declines rapidly in the 21st century, making glaciers a limiting source for ice melt. Using two climate models, we project sea level rise due to melting of mountain glaciers and icecaps to be 0.046 and 0.051 m by 2100, about half that of previous projections1,8. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

We find that a total sea-level rise of about 2 meters by 2100 could occur under physically possible glaciological conditions but only if all variables are quickly accelerated to extremely high limits. More plausible but still accelerated conditions lead to total sea-level rise by 2100 of about 0.8 meter.

	Abstract = {We present estimates of sea-level change caused by the global surface mass balance of glaciers, based on the reconstruction and projection of the surface mass balance of all the individual glaciers of the world, excluding the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The model is validated using a leave-one-glacier-out cross-validation scheme against 3997 observed surface mass balances of 255 glaciers, and against 756 geodetically observed, temporally integrated volume and surface area changes of 341 glaciers. When forced with observed monthly precipitation and temperature data, the glaciers of the world are reconstructed to have lost mass corresponding to 114 $\pm$ 5 mm sea-level equivalent (SLE) between 1902 and 2009. Using projected temperature and precipitation anomalies from 15 coupled general circulation models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble, they are projected to lose an additional 148 $\pm$ 35 mm SLE (scenario RCP26), 166 $\pm$ 42 mm SLE (scenario RCP45), 175 $\pm$ 40 mm SLE (scenario RCP60), or 217 $\pm$ 47 mm SLE (scenario RCP85) during the 21st century. Based on the extended RCP scenarios, glaciers are projected to approach a new equilibrium towards the end of the 23rd century, after having lost either 248 $\pm$ 66 mm SLE (scenario RCP26), 313 $\pm$ 50 mm SLE (scenario RCP45), or 424 $\pm$ 46 mm SLE (scenario RCP85). Up until approximately 2100, ensemble uncertainty within each scenario is the biggest source of uncertainty for the future glacier mass loss; after that, the difference between the scenarios takes over as the biggest source of uncertainty.

	Abstract = {It is standard to compare climate model results covering the past millennium and reconstructions based on various archives in order to test the ability of models to reproduce the observed climate variability. Up to now, glacier length fluctuations have not been used systematically in this framework even though they offer information on multi-decadal to centennial variations complementary to other records. One reason is that glacier length depends on several complex factors and so cannot be directly linked to the simulated climate. However, climate model skill can be measured by comparing the glacier length computed by a glacier model driven by simulated temperature and precipitation to observed glacier length variations. This is done here using the version 1.0 of the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) forced by fields derived from a range of simulations performed with global climate models over the past millennium. The glacier model is applied to a set of Alpine glaciers for which observations cover at least the 20th century. The observed glacier length fluctuations are generally well within the range of the simulations driven by the various climate model results, showing a general consistency with this ensemble of simulations. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the results are much more sensitive to the simulated climate than to OGGM parameters. This confirms that the simulations of glacier length can be used to evaluate the climate model performance, in particular the simulated summer temperatures that largely control the glacier changes in our region of interest. Simulated glacier length is strongly influenced by the internal variability in the system, putting limitations on the model-data comparison for some variables like the trends over the 20th century in the Alps. Nevertheless, comparison of glacier length fluctuations on longer timescales, for instance between the 18th century and the late 20th century, appear less influenced by the natural variability and indicate clear differences in the behaviour of the various climate models.},

	Abstract = {Despite their importance for sea-level rise, seasonal water availability, and as a source of geohazards, mountain glaciers are one of the few remaining subsystems of the global climate system for which no globally applicable, open source, community-driven model exists. Here we present the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM), developed to provide a modular and open-source numerical model framework for simulating past and future change of any glacier in the world. The modeling chain comprises data downloading tools (glacier outlines, topography, climate, validation data), a preprocessing module, a mass-balance model, a distributed ice thickness estimation model, and an ice-flow model. The monthly mass balance is obtained from gridded climate data and a temperature index melt model. To our knowledge, OGGM is the first global model to explicitly simulate glacier dynamics: the model relies on the shallow-ice approximation to compute the depth-integrated flux of ice along multiple connected flow lines. In this paper, we describe and illustrate each processing step by applying the model to a selection of glaciers before running global simulations under idealized climate forcings. Even without an in-depth calibration, the model shows very realistic behavior. We are able to reproduce earlier estimates of global glacier volume by varying the ice dynamical parameters within a range of plausible values. At the same time, the increased complexity of OGGM compared to other prevalent global glacier models comes at a reasonable computational cost: several dozen glaciers can be simulated on a personal computer, whereas global simulations realized in a supercomputing environment take up to a few hours per century. Thanks to the modular framework, modules of various complexity can be added to the code base, which allows for new kinds of model intercomparison studies in a controlled environment. Future developments will add new physical processes to the model as well as automated calibration tools. Extensions or alternative parameterizations can be easily added by the community thanks to comprehensive documentation.

	Abstract = {Recent studies of Asian glaciers have shown that glaciers in eastern Karakoram and West Kunlun have been slightly gaining mass while those in nearby Jammu Kashmir and Himalayas are losing mass, at rates of more than 0.5 m w.e.yr-1 and about 0.3 m w.e.yr-1, respectively. Two possible explanations have been proposed for this difference in glacier behaviour: spatial heterogeneity in climate change (climatic forcing) or differing glacier responses to climate change (glacier response). However, neither explanation has strong supporting evidence. Here, we examine the glacial response by calculating the mass-balance sensitivity to temperature change in high-mountain Asia. In support of the glacier-response explanation, we find a strong correlation between observed glacier surface-elevation changes and mass-balance sensitivity of glaciers. The high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.61) suggests that spatially heterogeneous mass-balance sensitivity has more explanatory power than regionally different climate change for the recent contrasting glacier fluctuations in the high mountain Asia.},

	Abstract = {The anticipated retreat of glaciers around the globe will pose far-reaching challengeto the management of fresh water resources and significantly contribute to sea-levrise within the coming decades. Here, we present a new model for calculating twenty-first century mass changes of all glaciers on Earth outside the ice sheets. ThGlobal Glacier Evolution Model (GloGEM) includes mass loss due to frontal ablation marine-terminating glacier fronts and accounts for glacier advance/retreat and surfacelevation changes. Simulations are driven with monthly near-surface air temperaturand precipitation from 14 Global Circulation Models forced by RCP2.6, RCP4.5, anRCP8.5 emission scenarios. Depending on the scenario, the model yields a global glacievolume loss of 25-48{\%} between 2010 and 2100. For calculating glacier contributioto sea-level rise, we account for ice located below sea-level presently displacing oceawater. This effect reduces the glacier contribution by 11-14{\%}, so that our model predicta sea-level equivalent (multi-model mean $\pm$1 standard deviation) of 79$\pm$24mm(RCP2.6108$\pm$28mm (RCP4.5), and 157$\pm$31mm (RCP8.5). Mass losses by frontal ablatioaccount for 10{\%}of total ablation globally, andupto ∼30{\%}regionally. Regional equilibriuline altitudes are projected to rise by ∼100-800m until 2100, but the effect on wastage depends on initial glacier hypsometries.},

	Abstract = {Changes in mass contained by mountain glaciers and ice caps can modify the Earth's hydrological cycle on multiple scales. On a global scale, the mass loss from glaciers contributes to sea-level rise. On regional and local scales, glacier meltwater is an important contributor to and modulator of river flow. In light of strongly accelerated worldwide glacier retreat, the associated glacier mass losses raise concerns over the sustainability of water supplies in many parts of the world. Here, we review recent attempts to quantify glacier mass changes and their effect on river runoff on regional and global scales. We find that glacier runoff is defined ambiguously in the literature, hampering direct comparison of findings on the importance of glacier contribution to runoff. Despite consensus on the hydrological implications to be expected from projected future warming, there is a pressing need for quantifying the associated regional-scale changes in glacier runoff and responses in different climate regimes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	Abstract = {The contribution to sea-level rise from mountain glaciers and ice caps has grown over the past decades. They are expected to remain an important component of eustatic sea-level rise for at least another century1,2, despite indications of accelerated wastage of the ice sheets3-5. However, it is difficult to project the future contribution of these small-scale glaciers to sea-level rise on a global scale. Here, we project their volume changes due to melt in response to transient, spatially differentiated twenty-first century projections of temperature and precipitation from ten global climate models. We conduct the simulations directly on the more than 120,000 glaciers now available in the World Glacier Inventory6, and upscale the changes to 19 regions that contain all mountain glaciers and ice caps in the world (excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets). According to our multi-model mean, sea-level rise from glacier wastage by 2100 will amount to 0.124 $\pm$ 0.037 m, with the largest contribution from glaciers in Arctic Canada, Alaska and Antarctica. Total glacier volume will be reduced by 21 $\pm$ 6{\%}, but some regions are projected to lose up to 75{\%} of their present ice volume. Ice losses on such a scale may have substantial impacts on regional hydrology and water availability7. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Volume-area power law scaling, one of a set of analytical scaling techniques based on principals of dimensional analysis, has become an increasingly important and widely used method for estimating the future response of the world's glaciers and ice caps to environmental change. Over 60 papers since 1988 have been published in the glaciological and environmental change literature containing applications of volume-area scaling, mostly for the purpose of estimating total global glacier and ice cap volume and modeling future contributions to sea level rise from glaciers and ice caps. The application of the theory is not entirely straightforward, however, and many of the recently published results contain analyses that are in conflict with the theory as originally described by Bahr et al. (1997). In this review we describe the general theory of scaling for glaciers in full three-dimensional detail without simplifications, including an improved derivation of both the volume-area scaling exponent $\gamma$ and a new derivation of the multiplicative scaling parameter c. We discuss some common misconceptions of the theory, presenting examples of both appropriate and inappropriate applications. We also discuss potential future developments in power law scaling beyond its present uses, the relationship between power law scaling and other modeling approaches, and some of the advantages and limitations of scaling techniques.},

@article{Raper2000,
	Abstract = {Towards accounting for the dynamic response of glaciers and ice caps in the estimation of their contribution to sea-level rise due to global warming, a mass-balance degree-day model is coupled to a geometric glacier model. The ice dynamics are treated implicitly in the geometric model by using scaling parameters that have been extensively investigated in the literature. The model is tested by presenting a case-study of the glacier Hintereisferner, Austrian Alps. The results are compatible with geomorphological data and other modelling studies. An estimate is made of the volume decrease due to initial disequilibrium. An extensive sensitivity study using generalized glacier shapes and sizes allows a comparison of results with dynamic theory. According to the geometric model, glaciers with a narrowing channel change more with a change in mass balance than glaciers with a widening channel, due to their shape and the way in which that shape changes with a changing climate. Also their response time is longer. As time progresses after a mass-balance perturbation, the longer response time for continental glaciers compared to glaciers with larger mass turnover offsets the effect of their smaller static sensitivity. Thus, although for the next century we may expect greater changes in volume from alpine glaciers, the equilibrium or committed change is greater for the continental glaciers.},

@article{Bahr2009,
	Abstract = {One of the most easily measured dimensions of a glacier, the accumulation area, is linked to future changes in glacier volume and consequent changes in sea level. Currently observed accumulation areas are too small, forcing glaciers to lose 27{\%} of their volume to attain equilibrium with current climate. As a result, at least 184 $\pm$ 33 mm of sea-level rise are necessitated by mass wastage of the world's mountain glaciers and ice caps even if the climate does not continue to warm. If the climate continues to warm along current trends, a minimum of 373 $\pm$21 mm of sea-level rise over the next 100 years is expected from glaciers and ice caps. When compared to recent estimates from all other sources, melt water from glaciers must be considered as a particularly important fraction of the total sea-level rise expected this century.
