    \subsection{Temperature index model} % (fold)
    \label{sub:temperature_index_model}

        In a nutshell, a glaciers annual specific surface mass balance $B$ is the difference between accumulation and over the course of a year. Hereby, accumulation refers to mass gain by snowfall, avalanches, snow drift, etc., while ablation refers to mass loss via ice melt, sublimation, calving, etc. The temperature index mass balance model used by the \vas{} model relies solely on the area average monthly solid precipitation onto the glacier surface $P_i^\text{solid}$ and the monthly mean air temperature at the glacier's terminus elevation $T_i^\text{terminus}$ as input. Hereby, the index $i$ denotes the month of the year. The mass balance equation described by \citet{Marzeion2012b} reads
        \begin{align}
            \label{eq:mass-balance}
            B = \left[\sum_{i=1}^{12}\left[
                    P_i^\text{solid}  - \mu^* \cdot \max\left(T_{i}^\text{terminus} - T_\text{melt},\ 0\right)
                \right]\right] - \beta^*.
        \end{align}
        The terminus temperature $T_{i}^\text{terminus}$ is computed by scaling the monthly average air temperature $T_i$ from the climate file reference elevation $z_\text{ref}$ to the glacier's terminus elevation $z_\text{min}$ using the temperature lapse rate $\gamma_\text{temp}$.
        \begin{align}
            T_i^\text{terminus} = T_i \cdot \gamma_\text{temp} (z_\text{min} - z_\text{ref})
        \end{align}
        The temperature at the maximum glacier elevation $T_{i}^\text{max}$ is computed analogously to terminus temperature: $T_{i}^\text{max} = T_i \cdot \gamma_\text{temp} (z_\text{max} - z_\text{ref})$, whereby $z_\text{max}$ represent the maximum glacier surface elevation. The positive melting temperature is computed as the difference between terminus temperature and temperature threshold for ice melt $T_\text{melt}$, with an obvious lower bound of \SI{0}{\celsius}. The glacier's temperature sensitivity \mustar{} relates the positive melting temperature to the actual ice loss and needs to be calibrated for each glacier (as does the potential mass balance residual \bias{}). The \hyperref[ssub:mb_calib]{calibration process} of these mass balance parameters is described below.
        
        The area average monthly solid precipitation onto the glacier surface $P_i^\text{solid}$ is computed from the total precipitation $P_i$ (given by the climate file) as
        \begin{align}\label{eq:solid-precip}
            P_i^\text{solid} = P_i \cdot f_\text{solid} \cdot (1 + \gamma_\text{precip} \cdot (z_\text{mean} - z_\text{ref})).
        \end{align}
        The total climatic precipitation $P_i$ is scaled from the reference elevation of the climate file $z_\text{ref}$ to the average glacier surface elevation $z_\text{mean}$ using the precipitation lapse rate $\gamma_\text{precip}$. The precipitation lapse rate $\gamma_\text{precip}$ is given in percentage of precipitation per meters of elevation change [\si{\percent\per\meter}]. The fraction of solid precipitation $f_\text{solid}$ depends on the terminus temperature $T_i^\text{terminus}$, the temperature at the maximum glacier surface elevation $T_i^\text{max}$ and the temperature thresholds for solid and liquid precipitation, $T^\text{solid}$ and $T^\text{liquid}$, respectively. For terminus temperatures below the threshold for solid precipitation, all precipitation is solid ($T_i^\text{terminus} < T^\text{solid} \ \Rightarrow f_\text{solid} = 1$). For temperatures at the maximum glacier surface elevation above the threshold for liquid precipitation, all precipitation is liquid ($T_i^\text{max} > T^\text{liquid} \Rightarrow f_\text{solid} = 0$). For temperatures in between, the fraction of solid precipitation is interpolated linearly as $f_\text{solid} = 1 + \frac{T_{i}^\text{terminus} - T^\text{solid}}{\gamma_\text{temp}\cdot(z_\text{max} - z_\text{min})}$.
        
        Climate models generally tend to underestimate the precipitation in mountainous regions, hence the monthly precipitation amount is additionally scaled by a factor $a$. While this scaling factor is implemented in the mass balance models (as \lstinline`prcp_scaling_factor`), it is not a physical component of the  mass balance equation and hence omitted in the Equation~\ref{eq:solid-precip} above. A global mean of $a = 2.5$ is found by \citet{Giesen2012}, whereas \citet{Marzeion2012c} found a mean of 2.1 for Central Europe and Scandinavia. The sensitivity study by \citet{Marzeion2012b} shows the strongest correlation between observed and modeled mass balance for $a \approx 1.3$ and the highest skill score for $a \approx 2.5$. The variability of the modeled mass-balance is quite low for values of $a \leq 2.5$.

        The values of the above mentioned hyper parameters (temperature thresholds, lapse rates, scaling factors, ...) can be calibrated, depending on the region and the used baseline climate. For Alpine model runs with the HISTALP baseline climate the following values are recommended (set as default in OGGM) and used this work \citep{Dusch2018}: $\gamma_\text{temp} = \SI{-6.5}{\kelvin\per\kilo\meter}$, $T^\text{melt} = \SI{-1.75}{\celsius}$, $\gamma_\text{precip} = 0$, $T^\text{solid} = \SI{0.0}{\celsius}$, $T^\text{liquid} = \SI{2.0}{\celsius}$, $a = 1.75$;

        \subsubsection{Calibration of the mass balance parameters} % fold
        \label{ssub:mb_calib}

            A complete and thorough description of the mass balance calibration process for this particular temperature index model can be found in \citet[Section 2.1.9, 2.1.10]{Marzeion2012b} and \citet[][Section 3.3]{Maussion2019}. The following section serves as a summary.
            
            The first step is to estimate the so called \emph{candidates} $\mu(t)$ for all glaciers with available mass balance records (254 glaciers globally, see \citet{WGMS2017}). This is done by requiring the average mass balance $\overline B(t)$ over the 31-year period centered around the year $t$ to be zero and solving for $\mu(t)$.
            \begin{align}\label{eq:mu-candidates}
                \mu(t) = \frac{P_\text{clim}^\text{solid}(t)}{\max(T_\text{clim}^\text{terminus(t)} - T_\text{melt}\, 0)},
            \end{align}
            whereby $P_{\text{clim}}^{\text{solid}}(t)$ and $T_{\text{clim}}^{\text{terminus}}(t)$ are the average yearly solid precipitation amount and average yearly air temperature at the glaciers terminus during the climatological period centered around the year $t$, respectively. The next step is to solve the mass balance equation (Eq.~\ref{eq:mass-balance}) for each candidate $\mu(t)$ and compare it to the mass balance observations. The computed difference $\beta(t)$ is a measure of how good the temperature sensitivity candidate $\mu(t)$ approximates the \textit{real} value of \mustar{}. Hence, \mustar{} is chosen as the candidate $\mu(t = t^*)$ for which the absolute bias is minimal $\beta^* \coloneqq \beta(t = t^*) \approx 0$, which in the best case is around zero. Hereby, the \textit{equilibrium year} \tstar{} represents the center of a 31-year climatic period where the given glacier geometry would stay in equilibrium. However, this is more of a model parameter and should not be overinterpreted as a real live value. The same is true for the corresponding temperature sensitivity \mustar{} and mass balance residual \bias{}.

            For all glaciers without mass balance records, \tstar{} and \bias{} are interpolated from the ten closest glaciers, inversely weighted with distance. The temperature sensitivity is computed by requiring the mass balance to be zero $\overline B(t^*) = 0$ and solving for \mustar{}. The temperature sensitivity \mustar{} depends highly on glacier specific factors, such as avalanches from surrounding terrain, topographical shading, etc. Therefore, \mustar{} can vary drastically from one glacier to another, even between neighboring glaciers. On the other hand, it is intuitively more likely for a glacier to be in equilibrium if its surrounding glaciers are in equilibrium as well. This is one major factor, why the interpolation of \tstar{} instead of \mustar{} reduces the mass balance error in a leave--one--out cross--validation \citep[cf.][]{Marzeion2012b, Maussion2019}.

        \subsubsection{Implementation note} % (fold)
        \label{ssub:mb_calib_implementation_note}

            The results of the steps above depend on the glacier outlines, the climate data and the mass balance hyper parameters (i.e., the temperature thresholds, lapse rates and the precipitation scaling factor). The equilibrium year \tstar{} and mass balance residual \bias{} computed for each reference glacier is stored in the \lstinline`ref_tstars.csv` file. Hence, for a given combination of RGI version, climate data and hyper parameters the calibration for the reference glaciers has to be done only once. Afterwards, it can be read directly from the corresponding file. OGGM comes with reference tables for combinations of RGI v5 and v6 and CRU4 and HISTALP.

        \subsubsection{Differences between the flowline mass balance model and the \vas{} mass balance model}

            The \vas{} mass balance model computes an average mass balance value for the entire glacier. The mass balance model requires only the minimal and maximal glacier elevation as additional input parameters ($z_\text{min}$, $z_\text{max}$), to compute the monthly terminus temperature $T_i^\text{termiuns}$ and the area averaged monthly amount of solid precipitation $P_i^\text{solid}$. The flowline model, on the other hand, requires a mass balance value for each grid point of the flowline (i.e., for each elevation band). Therefore, the mass balance is a function of elevation $B(z)$ and the elevation of the grid points must be supplied. Solid precipitation and air temperature are then computed for the given points of elevation, resulting in a point mass balance.

    \subsection{Glacier evolution model} % (fold)
    \label{sub:glacier_evolution_model}

        % Volume/area scaling must be used in conjuncture with proper response time scaling (Bahr, 2015)
        \Vas{} is derived from the full set of continuum equations with no assumptions of plane strain, shallow ice, perfect plasticity, or steady state conditions. This derivation from the fully time dependent equation of motion allows the volume $V$, area $A$ and scaling constant $c_A$ to change with time. Especially the scaling constant $c_A$ can incorporate transient behavior, since it depends on closing conditions which show an explicit time dependency. However, to explicitly include a temporal component, \vas{} has to be used in conjuncture with proper response time scaling. Response time scaling is a separate but equally valid scaling relation, derived during the same dimensionless analysis. Hence, these two scaling relations cannot be separated and have to be applied together to successfully model glacier evolution \citep{Bahr2015}.

        % Initialization: start with area, compute volume and length from scaling relations
        The \vas{} model starts with an initial glacier surface area $A_0$ as input. The initial glacier volume $V_0$ and the initial glacier length $L_0$ are computed using the \vas{} relation and the inverted volume/length scaling relation, respectively (cf. Section~\ref{sub:glacier_volume_area_scaling}).
        \begin{align}
            \begin{split}
                V_0 = c_A\cdot A_0^\gamma \qquad\qquad L_0 = \left(\frac{V_0}{c_L}\right)^\frac{1}{q}
            \end{split}
        \end{align}
        Additionally, only a mass balance model and the initial terminus elevation $z_{\text{min},0}$ and maximal glacier surface elevation $z_\text{max}$ are needed.

        % Yearly steps
        The \vas{} model runs with yearly time steps $\Delta t = \SI{1}{\year}$. Each time step from year $t$ to year $t+1$ includes the following steps:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Compute the time scale of the glacier's length change response to volume change $\tau_L$ and the time scale of the glacier's surface area change response to volume change $\tau_A$ as
            \begin{align}
                \begin{split}
                    \tau_L(t) = \frac{V(t)}{P^\text{solid}_\text{clim}(t^*)\cdot A(t)}
                    \qquad\qquad
                    \tau_A(t) = \tau_L(t)\frac{A(t)}{L(t)^2}
                \end{split}
            \end{align}
            As introduced during the calibration process, $P^\text{solid}_\text{clim}(t^*)$ is the average solid precipitation during the 31-year period centered around \tstar{}. For more details see \citet{Marzeion2012b}. The implementation includes lower bounds for both time scales as well as the climatological turnover, for details see Section~\ref{sub:glacier_evolution_model_implementation}.
            \item Get the specific mass balance $B(t)$ from mass balance model, by solving Equation~\ref{eq:mass-balance}. For implementation details see Section~\ref{sub:mass_balance_models_implementation}
            \item Compute the volume change $\Delta V(t) = \frac{1}{\rho_\text{ice}}A(t)\cdot B(t)$ as product of specific mass balance and glacier surface area. The volume change happens instantaneously, i.e., over one time step, hence the updated volume equals the sum of current volume and volume change $V(t+1) = V(t) + \Delta V(t)$.
            \item The (hypothetical) equilibrium surface area can be computed by inverting the \vas{} relation $(V(t+1)/c_A)^{1/\gamma}$. However, the surface area does not change instantaneously, and proper response time scaling must be applied. Hence, the area change is computed as
            \begin{align}
                \Delta A(t) = \frac{1}{\tau_A}\left(\left(\frac{V(t+1)}{c_A}\right)^\frac{1}{\gamma} - A(t)\right).
            \end{align}
            The updated area then equals the sum of current area and area change $A(t+1) = A(t) + \Delta A(t)$.
            \item The updated glacier length and length change are computed analogously to the glacier surface elevation. $L(t+1) = L(t) + \Delta L(t)$, with
            \begin{align}
                \Delta L(t) = \frac{1}{\tau_L}\left(\left(\frac{V(t+1)}{c_L}\right)^\frac{1}{q} - L(t)\right).
            \end{align}
            \item Adjust terminus elevation $z_\text{min}$, assuming a linear elevation change with changing glacier length (i.e., constant slope):
            \begin{align}
                z_\text{min}(t+1) = z_\text{max} + \frac{L(t)}{L_0}(z_{\text{min},0} - z_\text{max})
            \end{align}
            The maximum glacier elevation stays constant during the entire model run $z_\text{max} = \text{const.}$
            
        \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Mass balance models} % (fold)
    \label{sub:mass_balance_models_implementation}

        \subsubsection{Volume/area scaling mass balance model} % (fold)
        \label{ssub:volume_area_scaling_mass_balance_model_implementation}

            The \lstinline`VAScalingMassBalance` model is the implementation of the \textit{original} mass balance model by \citet{Marzeion2012b}. The model computes the mass balance of a glacier during the climate data period. The general concept is fairly similar to the \lstinline`oggm.core.massbalance.PastMassBalance` model. The main difference is, that the \vas{} mass balance model returns only one glacier wide average mass balance value, instead of point mass balance values for the different elevation bands.

            The mass balance model is initialized for a single glacier, denoted by the OGGM specific glacier directory \lstinline`gdir`. Per default, the model will use the calibrated mass balance parameters \mustar{} and \bias{} and read temperature and precipitation records from the preprocessed climate file \lstinline`climate_historical`. An alternative climate file can be used, by supplying either the filename and/or it's suffix via the parameters \lstinline`filename` and \lstinline`input_filesuffix`, repecitvely. It is possible to specify the start year and end year of the climate period (\lstinline`ys` and \lstinline`ye`), if not all available data should be used. The parameter \lstinline`repeat` controlls whether the climate period given by \lstinline`[ys, ye]` should be repeated indefinitely in a circular way.

            The \vas{} mass balance model inherits the following methods from the \lstinline`oggm.core.massbalance.MassBalanceModel` super class:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \lstinline`get_annual_climate()` and \lstinline`get_monthly_climate()` compute and return the mass balance relevant climate information, i.e. positive air temperature at the terminus elevation in \si{\celsius} and solid precipitation amount in \si{\kg\per\square\m}, for the given year and month/year combination, respectively.
                \item \lstinline`get_annual_mb()` and \lstinline`get_monthly_mb()` compute and return the glacier wide average mass balance in \si{\m\per\s}, for the given year and month/year combination, respectively. The possible mass balance residual \bias{} is applied.
                \item \lstinline`get_specific_mb()` and \lstinline`get_monthly_specific_mb()` compute and return the glacier wide average specific mass balance in \si{mm w.e.\per yr}, for the given year and month/year combination, respectively. The possible mass balance residual \bias{} is applied.
            \end{itemize}
            All methods need the glacier terminus elevation \lstinline`min_hgt` and the maximal glacier surface elevation \lstinline`max_hgt` as parameters. The date is supplied via the \lstinline`year` parameter, using the hydrological float year convention. Given that the scaling mass balance model computes the glacier wide average mass balance, it is not possible to estimate the equilibrium line altitude. Hence, the the method \lstinline`get_ela()` is not implemented, in contrast to the \lstinline`PastMassBalance` model.
        
        % subsubsection volume_area_scaling_mass_balance_model_implementation (end)

        \subsubsection{Constant climate scenario} % (fold)
        \label{ssub:constant_climate_scenario_implementation}
            The \lstinline`ConstantMassBalance` model simulates a constant climate based on the observations averaged over a 31-year period centered on a given year \lstinline`y0`. Hence, the specific mass balance does not change from year to year. The task \lstinline`run_constant_climate(gdir, ...)` initializes a \lstinline`ConstantMassBalance` for the given glacier \lstinline`gdir` and runs for a given number of years \lstinline`nyears`. The task takes an additional temperature bias as parameters \lstinline`temp_bias`, to alter the observed climate records.

            The same idea of a constant climate is used during the mass balance calibration, solving the mass balance equation (Equation~\ref{eq:mass-balance}) for the temperature sensitivity \mustar. So per definition, \mustar{} is the temperature sensitivity to keep the glacier in equilibrium over the 31-year climate period centered around the \textit{equilibrium year} \tstar{} while neglecting a potential mass balance residual \bias. Consequentially, a \lstinline`ConstantMassBalance` model with \lstinline`y0` = \tstar{} keeps the glacier in equilibrium.
        
        % subsubsection constant_climate_scenario_implementation (end)

        \subsubsection{Random climate scenario} % (fold)
        \label{ssub:random_climate_scenario_implementation}

            Similar to the \lstinline`ConstantMassBalance` model, the \lstinline`RandomMassBalance` model is based on a 31-year period centered on a given year \lstinline`y0`. However, the mass balance years are randomly shuffled within that period. More precise, for each simulated year the model computes the specific mass balance using temperature and precipitation records from a randomly selected year within the given period. Hence, the model runs on a synthetic random climate scenario based on actual observations. A seed \lstinline`seed`' for the random generator can be supplied as parameter, to allow for reproducibility. Additionally, it is possible to choose between draws with and without replacement via the \lstinline`unique_sample` parameter.

            The task \lstinline`run_random_climate(gdir, ...)` works analogously to the task \lstinline`run_constant_climate(gdir, ...)`, using an instance of \lstinline`RandomMassBalance` model instead of the \lstinline`ConstantMassBalance` model. Hence, using the climatological period centered around \lstinline`y0` = \tstar, the model glacier should stay in an equilibrium state while underlying minor fluctuations. Supplying a positive or negative temperature bias will result in a retreating or advancing model glacier, respectively, reaching a new equilibrium after some years.

    \subsection{Glacier evolution model} % (fold)
    \label{sub:glacier_evolution_model_implementation}

        The \lstinline`oggm-vas.VAScalingModel` is the implementation of the above describe glacier evolution model (see Section~\ref{sub:glacier_evolution_model}, \citet[cf.]{Marzeion2012b}) into the OGGM framework. The full source code is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/OGGM/oggm-vas}{GitHub}.

        An instance of the \lstinline`oggm-vas.VAScalingModel` class is initialized with the initial area \lstinline`area_m2_0`, the initial glacier terminus elevation \lstinline`min_hgt` and maximum glacier surface elevation \lstinline`max_hgt` and an instance of a \lstinline`oggm-vas.VAScalingMassBalance` model. Additionally, the start year of the simulation \lstinline`year_0` must be defined. Those initial values are stored as instance variables, since they are needed for later computations. Other than that, the \lstinline`oggm-vas.VAScalingModel` object stores all model parameters as instance variables for the current year it is in. This includes glacier geometries ($V$, $A$, $L$, $z_\text{min}$, $z_\text{max}$) and their changes ($\Delta V$, $\Delta A$, $\Delta L$), time scales ($\tau_A$, $\tau_L$), the mass balance model and the specific mass balance $B$, but also constants like the scaling parameters ($c_A$, $\gamma$, $c_L$, $q$) and ice density $\rho_\text{ice}$.

        To advance the glacier model, there are three different methods. The \lstinline`step()` method advances the model by one year, following the above described steps (see Section~\ref{sub:glacier_evolution_model}). The method \lstinline`run_until(year_end)` runs the model until the specified year and returns the geometric glacier parameters at the end of the model evolution (year, length, area, volume, terminus elevation and specific mass balance). Thereby, the model starts from whatever year it currently is in. It is possible to start the model run from \lstinline`year_0` with the flag \lstinline`reset`. The method \lstinline`run_until_and_store()` works analagous to the previous one, with the difference that all parameters are stored for each time step (i.e., for each year). The resulting data set is returned and possible stored to file, if a file path is give. The method \lstinline`run_until_equilibrium()` tries to run the glacier model until an equilibrium state is reached. The model runs for a fixed number of iteratrions \lstinline`max_ite`, the total elapsed time changes with the chosen time step \lstinline`ystep`. The iteration breaks, either if the glacier volume is below \SI{1}{\cubic\meter} or an equilibirum is reached. An equilibrium state is reached, if the volume change rate $|V(t) - V(t+\Delta t)|/V(t)$ falls below a given value \lstinline`rate`. Therefore, the method can only be used with a \hyperref[ssub:constant_climate_scenario_implementation]{constant climate scenario} (see Section~\ref{sub:mass_balance_models_implementation}).

    \subsection{Equilibrium runs} % (fold)
    \label{sub:equilibrium_runs_setup}
        As most things in nature, glaciers strive toward an equilibrium condition. Such an equilibrium is reached eventually, by changing the glacier's geometry in reaction to changes in climatic conditions. Analyzing the behavior of a glacier model subjected to a step change in climate can be used to estimate response times and to get insight into the dynamics of the numerical model, among others. The OGGM provides two convenient climate scenarios (or rather mass balance models) for such equilibrium experiment: the \lstinline`ConstantMassBalance` model and the \lstinline`RandomMassBalance` model. The implementation and workings of both mass balance models are described in Section~\ref{sub:mass_balance_models_implementation} (see \hyperref[ssub:constant_climate_scenario_implementation]{constant} and \hyperref[ssub:random_climate_scenario_implementation]{random} climate scenario). The hereafter detailed equilibrium experiments use the HISTALP dataset \citep{Auer2007} as climate input data, with the corresponding hyper parameters (see  \href{https://oggm.org/2018/08/10/histalp-parameters/}{Mass-balance model calibration for the Alps} \citep{Dusch2018} on the OGGM blog for more information). This obviously limits the suitable glaciers to the ones inside the HISTALP domain, i.e. the Alps. The HISTALP domain corresponds to the region 11-01 of the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) \citep{RGI2017,Pfeffer2014} (version 6.x) and lists 3892 glaciers.

        The following paragraph briefly lists the preprocessing tasks needed for the equilibrium runs. For a detailed description of OGGM workflow see \citet{Maussion2019} and the \href{https://docs.oggm.org}{OGGM documentation}.

            \item[GIS tasks:] using the digital elevation model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (\href{http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/}{SRTM}, \citet{Jarvis2008}) and the RGI glacier outlines to compute a local grid, compute a glacier mask, compute centerlines and corresponding catchment areas;
            \item[climate tasks:] extract the HISTALP time series for the grid point nearest to the glacier and write it in the \lstinline`climate_historical.nc` file;
            \item[mass balance calibration:] computing the glacier specific mass balance parameters \tstar{}, \mustar{} and \bias{};
            \item[inversion tasks:] running the ice thickness inversion to estimate the bed topography (needed only for the flowline model);
        \end{description}

        The actual model runs are invoked via the \lstinline`run_constant_climate` and \lstinline`run_random_climate` tasks (see Section~\ref{sub:mass_balance_models_implementation} for implementation details). The used settings depend on the intended experiment and are detailed in the following section.

        \subsubsection{Hintereisferner test case} % (fold) TODO: change section name/title
        \label{ssub:hintereisferner_test_case_setup}

            A first qualitative look at the \vas{} performance uses the Hintereisferner (RGI60-11.00897) as test case. This test case is intended to
            \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\alph*)]
              \item get a feel for the \vas{} model and set the stage for the following experiments
              \item compare the two mass balance models suitable for equilibrium experiments.
            \end{enumerate*}
            It has to be noted that \vas{} applied to single glaciers gives only an order of magnitude estimation. The scaling constant $c$ is a globally averaged value, and the relative error in scaling constant is directly proportional to the error in estimated ice volume \citep{Bahr2015}. However, a qualitative comparison between the \vas{} model and the flowline model is more practicable and meaningful for a single glacier. % TODO: add reference to scaling constant sensibility analysis

            % Mass balance calibration and mass balance models using the same tstar
            For this first experiment, both evolution models run with the \lstinline`ConstantMassBalance` model and the \lstinline`RandomMassBalance` model, for 1000 years each. Both mass balance models emulate an equilibrium climate to keep the glacier in its initial equilibrium state. Therefore, the mass balance models must be initialized with the climatic period centered around the equilibrium year, i.e., \lstinline`y0` = \tstar{}. As explained above, the mass balance calibration depends, among others, on the chosen \tstar{} (Section~\ref{sub:temperature_index_model}, see \hyperref[ssub:mb_calib]{Calibration of the mass balance parameters}). Hence, to run both evolution models with the identical climatic forcing, \tstar{} must be equal for both evolution models. This is done by computing the temperature sensitivity \mustar{} for both models using the same \tstar{} reference table (\lstinline`oggm_ref_tstars_rgi6_histalp.csv`, corresponding to the flowline model). Additionally, the mass balance residual must be omitted during the model run ($\beta^*$ = 0, as per the definition of \mustar{}, see Section~\ref{sub:temperature_index_model}). For a broader range of comparable data, each mass balance model runs three different climate scenarios defined by the temperature biases of \SI{0}{\celsius}, \SI{-0.5}{\celsius} and \SI{+0.5}{\celsius}. These runs will be referred to as \emph{equilibrium run}, run with \emph{positive mass balance bias} and run with \emph{negative mass balance bias}, respectively.

        \subsubsection{Single glaciers under random climate scenario} % (fold)
        \label{ssub:single_glaciers_under_random_climate_scenario_setup}

            \Vas{} applied to single glaciers gives only an order of magnitude estimation, since the scaling constant $c$ is a globally averaged value \citep{Bahr2015}. However, a qualitative comparison between the \vas{} model and the flowline model is more practicable and meaningful for single glaciers. The results of hereafter explained model runs are used for a \hyperref[sub:autocorrelation_analysis_results]{autocorrelation analysis} and a \hyperref[sub:power_spectrum_analysis_results]{power spectrum density analysis}. The main focus hereby lies on the intricate inner workings of the evolution models, much rather than on absolute values or future ice volume projections.

            Both evolution models run for 10\.000 years with the \lstinline`RandomMassBalance` model. The mass balance model is initialized around the respective \textit{equilibrium year} for each glacier (\lstinline`y0` = \tstar). Each glacier is subjected to three different climate scenarios, depending on the given temperature bias of \SI{0}{\celsius}, \SI{-0.5}{\celsius} and \SI{+0.5}{\celsius}. This results in an equilibrium run, a run with positive initial mass balance and a run with negative initial mass balance.

            As explained above, the mass balance model calibration depends on the chosen \textit{equilibrium year} \tstar{} (Section~\ref{sub:temperature_index_model}, see \hyperref[ssub:mb_calib]{Calibration of the mass balance parameters}). To keep a glacier in its initial equilibrium state, the \lstinline`RandomMassBalance` model must be initialized with the climatic period centered around \lstinline`y0` = \tstar{}. Additionally, the mass balance residual must be omitted during the model run ($\beta^*$ = 0, as per the definition of \mustar{}, see Section~\ref{sub:temperature_index_model}). Hence, to run both evolution models with the identical climatic forcing, a given glacier must have the same \tstar{} for both evolution models. This is done by computing the temperature sensitivity \mustar{} for both models using the same \tstar{} reference table (\lstinline`oggm_ref_tstars_rgi6_histalp.csv` corresponding to the flowline model).

            The yearly geometric properties (length, area and volume) of each model glacier are stored to file. In addition to the absolute values, a dataset with normalized values (with respect to the initial value) is produced, allowing better comparability between the evolution models.

        \subsubsection{Commitment runs} % (fold)
        \label{ssub:commitment_runs_setup}
            
            One of the easiest ways of estimating future glacial evolution are so called \textit{commitment runs}.
            The name stems from the \textit{commitment} to a given climate, which is then held constant for the entire run.
            For example, applying the current climate to the current glaciers for the next, say, 100 years, gives a (naively optimistic) lower bound of glacial retreat in the Alps. Since both mass balance models allow for a temperature bias, multiple scenarios can be explored.

            % mass balance calibration
            These scenarios are intended to reflect the reality as good as possible. Hence, the default OGGM \hyperref[ssub:mb_calib]{mass balance calibration} is used (see Section~\ref{sub:temperature_index_model}). To be more precise, each evolution model uses its own \tstar{} reference table (which may result in different \tstar{} for the same glacier depending on the evolution model) and the mass balance residual \bias{} is used for each run.

            % equilibrium climate
            The first regional simulation is based on an equilibrium climate, similarly to the runs with \hyperref[ssub:single_glaciers_under_random_climate_scenario_setup]{single glaciers under random climate}. The mass balance models are initialized with \lstinline`y0` = \tstar{} and run with three different temperature biases of \SI{0}{\celsius}, \SI{-0.5}{\celsius} and \SI{+0.5}{\celsius}. Both evolution models run for 1'000 years with the \lstinline`ConstantMassBalance` model and with the \lstinline`RandomMassBalance` model. This experiment allows to investigate the model's sensitivity to random annual fluctuations and serves as \textit{baseline} for the following simulations.

            % todays climate
            While a climate scenario with yearly fluctuations is more physical than a constant climate, the resulting ice volume changes are comparable (see Section~\ref{sub:time_series_results}). Which is why, the following experiments can be limited to the \lstinline`ConstantMassBalance` model without any loss of information. For a more tangible experiment, the mass balance model is initialized with todays climate. Todays climate is assumed to be the average over the most recent 31 years. For the HISTALP dataset this corresponds to the period from 1984 to 2014 with \lstinline`y0 = 1999`. Since we live in a period of global warming, only positive temperature biases of \SI{0}{\celsius}, \SI{+0.5}{\celsius} and \SI{+1.5}{\celsius} are used. As before, absolute and normalized values of yearly geometric properties are stored to allow further investigations.
