\noindent First and foremost I want to thank my supervisor Fabien Maussion. He sparked the idea of implementing the \vas{} model during the Hacktoberfest 2018 at our institute; he gave me the liberty and the time I needed to develop and test ideas, make my own mistakes and learn from them while still providing guidance and tutelage; and most importantly, over the last couple of months he steered me towards the finish line and was an essential help in sharpening my points and in finalizing this entire project.\\[0.3cm]
\noindent Additional thanks go to Ben Marzeion for providing me with the original model code and answering some questions about the implementation and conceptual details, as well as Matthias Dusch, Jan-Hendrik Malles, Timo Rothenspieler and the entire OGGM community for helping with coding problems and providing feedback to model results.\\[0.3cm]
\noindent I would like to thank my parents and grandparents for their continued support, not only during my studies but throughout my life. Special thanks go to my fianc√©e Carmen for her encouragement and moral support, and also just for enduring me during the more stressful times.\\[0.3cm]
\noindent Furthermore I would like to thank everybody else not mentioned by name who contributed to this thesis in any way, shape or form: by engaging in thematic discussions about harmonic oscillations or color schemes, by calling or swinging by and providing some much needed distraction, or by motivating me when I was about to throw it all away.\\[0.3cm]
\noindent And ``last but not least'', to quote Snoop Dogg, ``I want to thank me. I want to thank me for believing in me. I want to thank me for doing all this hard work. [...] I want to thank me for never quitting.''
