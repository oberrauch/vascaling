abstract = {I assess the feasibility of using multivariate scaling relationships to estimate glacier volume from glacier inventory data. Scaling laws are calibrated against volume observations optimized for the specific purpose of estimating total global glacier ice volume. I find that adjustments for continentality and elevation range improve skill of area-volume scaling. These scaling relationships are applied to each record in the Randolph Glacier Inventory, which is the first globally complete inventory of glaciers and ice caps. I estimate that the total volume of all glaciers in the world is 0.35 ± 0.07 m sea level equivalent, including ice sheet peripheral glaciers. This is substantially less than a recent state-of-the-art estimate. Area-volume scaling bias issues for large ice masses, and incomplete inventory data are offered as explanations for the difference. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {The transient response of glaciers to climate variations is investigated with a novel low-order model of an idealized glacier resting on uniformly inclined bedrock. The model consists of two volumes representing the accumulation and ablation areas, which are joined by a flux gate controlling mass flow according to the shallow-ice approximation. Under the assumption of a constant vertical mass-balance gradient, a volume-length scaling relation is derived which depends explicitly on mass-balance gradient and bedrock slope. Analytic expressions for the volume and area timescales are given, which are inversely proportional to the mass-balance gradient and a geometric factor which is the ratio between the vertical extent of the ablation area and the ice thickness at the equilibrium line. From the low-order model, a dynamical system in length and volume is obtained. Results from this system are in good agreement with solutions obtained from a transient finite-element model solving the full force-balance and mass-conservation equations. Under periodic forcing there are significant deviations of the length response, which show that the usual relaxation-type parameterization of length change is not well suited for short-term reactions. Switching on and off periodic climate forcing, the model glaciers show surprisingly large initial and final transient responses that have not been investigated before. These results are of significance for the interpretation of length and thickness changes observed on glaciers.},

abstract = {Volume-area scaling is the most popular method for estimating the ice volume of large glacier samples. Here, a series of resampling experiments based on different sets of synthetic data is presented in order to derive an upper-bound estimate (i.e. a level achieved only within ideal conditions) for its accuracy. For real-world applications, a lower accuracy has to be expected. We also quantify the maximum accuracy expected when scaling is used for determining the glacier volume change, and area change of a given glacier population. A comprehensive set of measured glacier areas, volumes, area and volume changes is evaluated to investigate the impact of real-world data quality on the so-assessed accuracies. For populations larger than a few thousand glaciers, the total ice volume can be recovered within 30{\%} if all data currently available worldwide are used for estimating the scaling parameters. Assuming no systematic bias in ice volume measurements, their uncertainty is of secondary importance. Knowing the individual areas of a glacier sample for two points in time allows recovering the corresponding ice volume change within 40{\%} for populations larger than a few hundred glaciers, both for steady-state and transient geometries. If ice volume changes can be estimated without bias, glacier area changes derived from volume-area scaling show similar uncertainties to those of the volume changes. This paper does not aim at making a final judgement on the suitability of volume-area scaling as such, but provides the means for assessing the accuracy expected from its application. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

Volume-area relations are used to take into account the reduction of glacier area resulting from greenhouse warming. Each glacieriated region has a specified glacier size distribution, defined by the number of glaciers in a size class and a mean area. Changes in glacier volume are calculated by a precipitation dependent mass balance sensitivity. The model predicts a global sea level rise of 57 mm over a period of 70 years. This corresponds to a sensitivity of 0.86 mm yr-1K-1. Assuming a constant glacier area as done in earlier work leads to an overestimation of 19{\%} for the contribution to sea level rise.},

They are expected to remain an important component of eustatic sea-level rise for at least another century1,2, despite indications of accelerated wastage of the ice sheets3-5. However, it is difficult to project the future contribution of these small-scale glaciers to sea-level rise on a global scale. Here, we project their volume changes due to melt in response to transient, spatially differentiated twenty-first century projections of temperature and precipitation from ten global climate models. We conduct the simulations directly on the more than 120,000 glaciers now available in the World Glacier Inventory6, and upscale the changes to 19 regions that contain all mountain glaciers and ice caps in the world (excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets). According to our multi-model mean, sea-level rise from glacier wastage by 2100 will amount to 0.124 ± 0.037 m, with the largest contribution from glaciers in Arctic Canada, Alaska and Antarctica. Total glacier volume will be reduced by 21 ± 6{\%}, but some regions are projected to lose up to 75{\%} of their present ice volume. Ice losses on such a scale may have substantial impacts on regional hydrology and water availability7. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A large part of present-day sea-level change is formed by the melt of glaciers and ice caps (GIC). This study focuses on the uncertainties in the calculation of the GIC contribution on a century timescale. The model used is based on volume-area scaling, combined with the mass balance sensitivity of the GIC. We assess different aspects that contribute to the uncertainty in the prediction of the contribution of GIC to future sea-level rise, such as (1) the volume-area scaling method (scaling factor), (2) the glacier data, (3) the climate models, and (4) the emission scenario. Additionally, a comparison of the model results to the 20th century GIC contribution is presented. We find that small variations in the scaling factor cause significant variations in the initial volume of the glaciers, but only limited variations in the glacier volume change. If two existing glacier inventories are tuned such that the initial volume is the same, the GIC sea-level contribution over 100 yr differs by 0.027 m or 18 {\%}. It appears that the mass balance sensitivity is also important: variations of 20 {\%} in the mass balance sensitivity have an impact of 17 {\%} on the resulting sea-level projections. Another important factor is the choice of the climate model, as the GIC contribution to sea-level change largely depends on the temperature and precipitation taken from climate models. Connected to this is the choice of emission scenario, used to drive the climate models. Combining all the uncertainties examined in this study leads to a total uncertainty of 0.052 m or 35 {\%} in the GIC contribution to global mean sea level. Reducing the variance in the climate models and improving the glacier inventories will significantly reduce the uncertainty in calculating the GIC contributions, and are therefore crucial actions to improve future sea-level projections. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2011.},

We present a statistical method for deriving regional and global ice volumes from regional glacier area distributions and volume area scaling using glacier area data from ∼ 123,000 glaciers from a recently extended World Glacier Inventory. We compute glacier volumes and their sea level equivalent (SLE) for 19 glacierized regions containing all mountain glaciers and ice caps on Earth. On the basis of total glacierized area of 741 x 103 ± 68 x 10 km2, we estimate a total ice volume of 241 x 103 ± 29 x 10 3 km3, corresponding to 0.60 ± 0.07 m SLE, of which 32{\%} is due to glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica apart from the ice sheets. However, our estimate is sensitive to assumptions on volume area scaling coefficients and glacier area distributions in the regions that are poorly inventoried, i.e., Antarctica, North America, Greenland, and Patagonia. This emphasizes the need for more volume observations, especially of large glaciers and a more complete World Glacier Inventory in order to reduce uncertainties and to arrive at firmer volume estimates for all mountain glaciers and ice caps.

They originate from the driving climate model, input data quality, and simplifications in the glacio-hydrological model and hamper the reliability of the simulations. Here, an integrative assessment of the uncertainty in 21st century glacier runoff is provided based on experiments using the Glacier Evolution Runoff Model (GERM) applied to the catchment of Findelengletscher, Switzerland. GERM is calibrated and validated in a multi-objective approach and is run using nine Regional Climate Models (RCMs) until 2100. Among others, the hydrological impacts of the RCM downscaling procedure, the winter snow accumulation, the surface albedo and the calculation of ice melt and glacier retreat are investigated. All experiments indicate rapid glacier wastage and a transient runoff increase followed by reduced melt season discharge. However, major uncertainties in, e.g., glacier area loss (-100{\%} to -63{\%}) and the change in annual runoff (-57{\%} to +25{\%} relative to today) by 2100 are found. The impact of model assumptions on changes in August runoff is even higher (-94{\%} to -5{\%}). The spread in RCM results accounts for 20-50{\%} of the overall uncertainty in modeled discharge. Initial ice thickness, the amount and spatial distribution of winter snow and the glacier retreat model have the largest effect on the projections, whereas the RCM downscaling procedure, calibration data quality and the melt model (energy balance vs. degree-day approach) are of secondary importance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Through numerical simulations of 3D, high-order glacier mechanics, we demonstrate how different topographic and climatic settings, glacier flow dynamics, and the degree of disequilibrium with climate systematically affect the volume-area relation. We recommend more accurate scaling relations through characterization of individual glacier shape, slope and size. An ensemble of 280 randomly-generated valley glaciers spanning a spectrum of plausible glaciological conditions yields a steady-state exponent = 1.46.

abstract = {Global warming is expected to significantly affect the runoff regime of mountainous catchments. Simple methods for calculating future glacier change in hydrological models are required in order to reliably assess economic impacts of changes in the water cycle over the next decades. Models for temporal and spatial glacier evolution need to describe the climate forcing acting on the glacier, and ice flow dynamics. Flow models, however, demand considerable computational resources and field data input and are moreover not applicable on the regional scale. Here, we propose a simple parameterization for calculating the change in glacier surface elevation and area, which is mass conserving and suited for hydrological modelling. The $\alpha$h-parameterization is an empirical glacier-specific function derived from observations in the past that can easily be applied to large samples of glaciers. We compare the $\alpha$h- parameterization to results of a 3-D finite-element ice flow model. As case studies, the evolution of two Alpine glaciers of different size over the period 2008-2100 is investigated using regional climate scenarios. The parameterization closely reproduces the distributed ice thickness change, as well as glacier area and length predicted by the ice flow model. This indicates that for the purpose of transient runoff forecasts, future glacier geometry change can be approximated using a simple parameterization instead of complex ice flow modelling. Furthermore, we analyse alpine glacier response to 21st century climate change and consequent shifts in the runoff regime of a highly glacierized catchment using the proposed methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Author(s).},

abstract = {It is standard to compare climate model results covering the past millennium and reconstructions based on various archives in order to test the ability of models to reproduce the observed climate variability. Up to now, glacier length fluctuations have not been used systematically in this framework even though they offer information on multi-decadal to centennial variations complementary to other records. One reason is that glacier length depends on several complex factors and so cannot be directly linked to the simulated climate. However, climate model skill can be measured by comparing the glacier length computed by a glacier model driven by simulated temperature and precipitation to observed glacier length variations. This is done here using the version 1.0 of the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) forced by fields derived from a range of simulations performed with global climate models over the past millennium. The glacier model is applied to a set of Alpine glaciers for which observations cover at least the 20th century. The observed glacier length fluctuations are generally well within the range of the simulations driven by the various climate model results, showing a general consistency with this ensemble of simulations. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the results are much more sensitive to the simulated climate than to OGGM parameters. This confirms that the simulations of glacier length can be used to evaluate the climate model performance, in particular the simulated summer temperatures that largely control the glacier changes in our region of interest. Simulated glacier length is strongly influenced by the internal variability in the system, putting limitations on the model-data comparison for some variables like the trends over the 20th century in the Alps. Nevertheless, comparison of glacier length fluctuations on longer timescales, for instance between the 18th century and the late 20th century, appear less influenced by the natural variability and indicate clear differences in the behaviour of the various climate models.},

We show the following: TM may in general be estimated by a volume time-scale describing the time required for a step change in mass balance to supply the volume difference between the initial and final steady states. The factor f in the classical estimate of TM = fl/u, where l is glacier length and u is terminus velocity, has a simple geometrical interpretation . It is the ratio of thickness change averaged over the full length l to the change at the terminus. Although both u and f relate to dynamic processes local to the terminus zone, the ratio f/u and, therefore, TM are insensitive to details of the terminus dynamics , in contrast to conclusions derived from some simplified kinematic wave models. A more robust estimate of TM independent of terminus dynamics is given by TM = h/(-b) where h is a thickness scale for the glacier and -b is the mass-balance rate (negative) at the terminus. We suggest that TM for mountain glaciers can be substantially less than the 10{\^{}}2-10{\^{}}3 years commonly considered to be theoretically expected.},

abstract = {Abstract. We present a minimal model of the glacier surface mass balance. The model relies solely on monthly precipitation and air temperatures as forcing. We first train the model individually for 15 glaciers with existing mass balance measurements. Based on a cross validation, we present a thorough assessment of the models performance outside of the training period. The cross validation indicates that our model is robust, and our models performance compares favorably to that from a less parsimonious model based on seasonal sensitivity characteristics. Then, the model is extended for application on glaciers without existing mass balance measurements. We cross validated the model again by withholding the mass balance information from each of the 15 glaciers above during the model training, in order to measure its performance on glaciers not included in the model training. This cross validation indicates that the model retains considerable skill even when applied on glaciers without mass balance measurements. As an exemplary application, the model is then used to reconstruct time series of interannual mass balance variability, covering the past two hundred years, for all glaciers in the European Alps contained in the extended format of the world glacier inventory. Based on this reconstruction, we present a spatially detailed attribution of the glaciers mass balance variability to temperature and precipitation variability},

abstract = {Discriminating between glacier variations due to natural climate variability and those due to true climate change is crucial for the interpretation and attribution of past glacier changes, and for the expectations of future changes. We explore this issue for the well-documented glaciers of Mount Baker in the Cascades Mountains of Washington State, USA, using glacier histories, glacier modeling, weather data and numerical weather model output. We find that natural variability alone is capable of producing kilometer-scale excursions in glacier length on multi-decadal and centennial timescales. Such changes are similar in magnitude to those attributed to a global Little Ice Age. The null hypothesis, that no climate change is required to explain the glacier fluctuations in this setting, cannot be rejected. These results for Mount Baker glaciers are also consistent with an earlier study analyzing individual glaciers in Scandinavia and the Alps. The principle that long-timescale fluctuations of glacier length can e driven by short-timescale fluctuations in climate reflects a robust and fundamental property of stochastically forced physical systems with memory. It is very likely that this principle also applies to other Alpine glaciers and that it therefore complicates interpretations of the relationship between glacier and climate history. However, the amplitude and timescale of the length fluctuations depends on the details of the particular glacier geometry and climatic setting, and this remains largely unevaluated for most glaciers.},

The numerical results reveal a surprising simplicity: the time evolution and spectral shape of glacier excursions depend on a single parameter, a time constant determined by the geometrical properties of the glacier. Furthermore, the numerical results reveal that perturbations in mass balance over the glacier surface set in motion a sequence of events that can be roughly described as occurring in three overlapping stages: (1) changes in interior thickness drive (2) changes in terminus flux, which in turn drive (3) changes in glacier length. A simple, third-order linear differential equation, which extends previous models in the literature, successfully captures these important features of the glacier flow. This three-stage linear model is readily invertible to recover climate history. It provides clear physical insight and analytical expressions for some important metrics of glacier behavior, such as variance, sensitivity and excursion probabilities. Finally, it facilitates uncertainty analysis. The linear model can also be adapted for arbitrary catchment geometry, and is applied to Nigardsbreen, Norway.},

The model is validated using a leave-one-glacier-out cross-validation scheme against 3997 observed surface mass balances of 255 glaciers, and against 756 geodetically observed, temporally integrated volume and surface area changes of 341 glaciers. When forced with observed monthly precipitation and temperature data, the glaciers of the world are reconstructed to have lost mass corresponding to 114 ± 5 mm sea-level equivalent (SLE) between 1902 and 2009. Using projected temperature and precipitation anomalies from 15 coupled general circulation models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble, they are projected to lose an additional 148 ± 35 mm SLE (scenario RCP26), 166 ± 42 mm SLE (scenario RCP45), 175 ± 40 mm SLE (scenario RCP60), or 217 ± 47 mm SLE (scenario RCP85) during the 21st century.

Over 60 papers since 1988 have been published in the glaciological and environmental change literature containing applications of volume-area scaling, mostly for the purpose of estimating total global glacier and ice cap volume and modeling future contributions to sea level rise from glaciers and ice caps. The application of the theory is not entirely straightforward, however, and many of the recently published results contain analyses that are in conflict with the theory as originally described by Bahr et al. (1997). In this review we describe the general theory of scaling for glaciers in full three-dimensional detail without simplifications, including an improved derivation of both the volume-area scaling exponent $\gamma$ and a new derivation of the multiplicative scaling parameter c. We discuss some common misconceptions of the theory, presenting examples of both appropriate and inappropriate applications. We also discuss potential future developments in power law scaling beyond its present uses, the relationship between power law scaling and other modeling approaches, and some of the advantages and limitations of scaling techniques.},

abstract = {Despite their importance for sea-level rise, seasonal water availability, and as a source of geohazards, mountain glaciers are one of the few remaining subsystems of the global climate system for which no globally applicable, open source, community-driven model exists. Here we present the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM), developed to provide a modular and open-source numerical model framework for simulating past and future change of any glacier in the world. The modeling chain comprises data downloading tools (glacier outlines, topography, climate, validation data), a preprocessing module, a mass-balance model, a distributed ice thickness estimation model, and an ice-flow model. The monthly mass balance is obtained from gridded climate data and a temperature index melt model. To our knowledge, OGGM is the first global model to explicitly simulate glacier dynamics: the model relies on the shallow-ice approximation to compute the depth-integrated flux of ice along multiple connected flow lines. In this paper, we describe and illustrate each processing step by applying the model to a selection of glaciers before running global simulations under idealized climate forcings. Even without an in-depth calibration, the model shows very realistic behavior. We are able to reproduce earlier estimates of global glacier volume by varying the ice dynamical parameters within a range of plausible values. At the same time, the increased complexity of OGGM compared to other prevalent global glacier models comes at a reasonable computational cost: several dozen glaciers can be simulated on a personal computer, whereas global simulations realized in a supercomputing environment take up to a few hours per century. Thanks to the modular framework, modules of various complexity can be added to the code base, which allows for new kinds of model intercomparison studies in a controlled environment. Future developments will add new physical processes to the model as well as automated calibration tools. Extensions or alternative parameterizations can be easily added by the community thanks to comprehensive documentation. OGGM spans a wide range of applications, from ice-climate interaction studies at millennial timescales to estimates of the contribution of glaciers to past and future sea-level change. It has the potential to become a self-sustained community-driven model for global and regional glacier evolution.},

Boreholes to the bed are expensive and time-consuming to drill, so the determination of basal velocity is almost exclusively by numerical inversion of velocities observed at the surface. For non-linearly viscous glaciers, a perturbation analysis demonstrates that inversions for englacial velocities will magnify measurement errors at an exponential rate with depth. The rate at which calculation errors grow is proportional to a Lyapunov exponent, a measure of "information loss' which is shown to be a simple linear function of spatial frequency with a coefficient depending on Glen's flow-law exponent, n.

However, direct measurements of ice thickness are laborious, not feasible everywhere and necessarily restricted to a small number of glaciers. In this paper, we present a method to estimate the ice-thickness distribution and the total ice volume of alpine glaciers. This method is based on glacier mass turnover and principles of ice-flow mechanics. The required input data are the glacier surface topography, the glacier outline and a set of borders delineating different 'ice-flow catchments'. Three parameters describe the distribution of the 'apparent mass balance', which is defined as the difference between the glacier surface mass balance and the rate of ice-thickness change, and two parameters define the ice-flow dynamics. The method was developed and validated on four alpine glaciers located in Switzerland, for which the bedrock topography is partially known from radio-echo soundings. The ice thickness along 82 cross-profiles can be reproduced with an average deviation of about 25{\%} between the calculated and the measured ice thickness. The cross-sectional areas differ by less than 20{\%} on average. This shows the potential of the method for estimating the ice-thickness distribution of alpine glaciers without the use of direct measurements.},

abstract = {Estimating a glacier's volume by inferring properties at depth (e.g. bed topography or basal slip) from properties observed at the surface (e.g. area and slope) creates a calculation instability that grows exponentially with the size of the glacier. Random errors from this inversion instability can overwhelm all other sources of error and can corrupt thickness and volume calculations, unless problematic short spatial wavelengths are specifically excluded. Volume/area scaling inherently filters these short wavelengths and automatically eliminates the instability, while numerical inversions can also give stable solutions by filtering the correct wavelengths explicitly, as is frequently done when 'regularizing' a model. Each of the scaling and numerical techniques has applications to which it is better suited, and there are trade-offs in resolution and accuracy; but when calculating volume, neither the modeling nor the scaling approach offers a fundamental advantage over the other. Both are significantly limited by the inherently 'ill-posed' inversion, and even though both provide stable volume solutions, neither can give unique solutions.},

abstract = {Volume-area scaling provides a practical alternative to ice-flow modelling to account for glacier size changes when modelling the future evolution of glaciers; however, uncertainties remain as to the validity of this approach under non-steady conditions. We address these uncertainties by deriving scaling exponents in the volume-area relationship from one-dimensional ice-flow modelling. We generate a set of 37 synthetic steady-state glaciers of different sizes, and then model their volume evolution due to climate warming and cooling as prescribed by negative and positive mass-balance perturbations, respectively, on a century timescale. The scaling exponent derived for the steady-state glaciers ($\gamma$ = 1.56) differs from the exponents derived for the glaciers in transient (non-steady) state by up to 86{\%}. Nevertheless, volume projections employing volume-area scaling are relatively insensitive to these differences in scaling exponents. Volume-area scaling agrees well with the results from ice-flow modelling. In addition, the scaling method is able to simulate the approach of a glacier to a new steady state, if mass-balance elevation feedback is approximated by removing or adding elevation bands at the lowest part of the glacier as the glacier retreats or advances. If area changes are approximated in the mass-balance computations in this way, our results indicate that volume-area scaling is a powerful tool for glacier volume projections on multi-century timescales.},

abstract = {Volume–area scaling is a common tool for deriving future volume evolutions of valley glaciers and their contribution to sea-level rise. We analyze the performance of scaling relationships for deriving volume projections in comparison to projections from a one-dimensional ice-flow model. The model is calibrated for six glaciers (Nigardsbreen, Rhonegletscher, South Cascade Glacier, Sofiyskiy glacier, midre Love´nbreen and Abramov glacier). Volume evolutions forced by different hypothetical mass-balance perturbations are compared with those obtained from volume–area (V-A), volume–length (V-L) and volume–area–length (V-A-L) scaling. Results show that the scaling methods mostly underestimate the volume losses predicted by the ice-flow model, up to 47{\%} for V-A scaling and up to 18{\%} for V-L scaling by the end of the 100 year simulation period. In general, V-L scaling produces closer simulations of volume evolutions derived from the ice-flow model, suggesting that V-L scaling may be a better approach for deriving volume projections than V-A scaling. Sensitivity experiments show that the initial volumes and volume evolutions are highly sensitive to the choice of the scaling constants, yielding both over- and underestimates. However, when normalized by initial volume, volume evolutions are relatively insensitive to the choice of scaling constants, especially in the V-L scaling. The 100 year volume projections differ within 10{\%} of initial volume when the V-A scaling exponent commonly assumed, ? ¼ 1.375, is varied by –30{\%} to +45{\%} (? ¼ [0.95, 2.00]) and the V-L scaling exponent, q ¼ 2.2, is varied by –30{\%} to +45{\%} (q ¼ [1.52, 3.20]). This is encouraging for the use of scaling methods in glacier volume projections, particularly since scaling exponents may vary between glaciers and the scaling constants are generally unknown.},

@article{Chen1990,
abstract = {An empirical formula relating volume of an Alpine glacier to the surface area is improved based on the data measured by radio-echo sounding and seismic method. The ice-covered area of the Alpine glaciers was 4369±54km2 in the 1870s, 3541±33km2 in the 1930s, and 2909km2 in the 1970s. For the period 1870s-1970s, the volume of Alpine glaciers decreased by 57.4±20.4km3 with the volume in the 1970s being 140±10km3. The mean rate of changes over this period is about -15km2/a for the ice-covered area, -0.574km3/a for the volume and -0.163m/a for the mean thickness. The mass-turnover time of an Alpine glacier, which is important in investigating the water cycle of a basin with glaciers, is estimated to be in the order of 101-102a. -from Authors},

@article{Bahr1997b,
abstract = {Ice volumes are known for only a few of the roughly 160,000 glaciers worldwide but are important components of many climate and sea level studies which require water flux estimates. A scaling analysis of the mass and momentum conservation equations shows that glacier volumes can be related by a power law to more easily observed glacier surface areas. The relationship requires four closure choices for the scaling behavior of glacier widths, slopes, side drag and mass balance. Reasonable closures predict a volume-area scaling exponent which is consistent with observations, giving a physical and practical basis for estimating ice volumes. Glacier volume is insensitive to perturbations in the mass balance scaling, but changes in average accumulation area ratios reflect significant changes in the scaling of both mass balance and ice volume.},

@article{Auer2007,
abstract = {This paper describes the HISTALP database, consisting of monthly homogenised records of temperature, pressure,
precipitation, sunshine and cloudiness for the ‘Greater Alpine Region' (GAR, 4–19 °E, 43–49 °N, 0–3500m asl). The
longest temperature and air pressure series extend back to 1760, precipitation to 1800, cloudiness to the 1840s and sunshine
to the 1880s. A systematic QC procedure has been applied to the series and a high number of inhomogeneities (more
than 2500) and outliers (more than 5000) have been detected and removed. The 557 HISTALP series are kept in different
data modes: original and homogenised, gap-filled and outlier corrected station mode series, grid-1 series (anomaly fields
at 1° × 1°, lat × long) and Coarse Resolution Subregional (CRS) mean series according to an EOF-based regionalisation.
The leading climate variability features within the GAR are discussed through selected examples and a concluding linear
trend analysis for 100, 50 and 25-year subperiods for the four horizontal and two altitudinal CRSs. Among the key findings
of the trend analysis is the parallel centennial decrease/increase of both temperature and air pressure in the 19th/20th
century. The 20th century increase (+1.2 °C/+1.1 hPa for annual GAR-means) evolved stepwise with a first peak near
1950 and the second increase (1.3 °C/0.6hPa per 25 years) starting in the 1970s. Centennial and decadal scale temperature
trends were identical for all subregions. Air pressure, sunshine and cloudiness show significant differences between low
versus high elevations. A long-term increase of the high-elevation series relative to the low-elevation series is given for
sunshine and air pressure. Of special interest is the exceptional high correlation near 0.9 between the series on mean
temperature and air pressure difference (high-minus low-elevation). This, further developed via some atmospheric statics
and thermodynamics, allows the creation of ‘barometric temperature series' without use of the measures of temperature.
They support the measured temperature trends in the region. Precipitation shows the most significant regional and seasonal
differences with, e.g., remarkable opposite 20th century evolution for NW (9{\%} increase) versus SE (9{\%} decrease). Other
long- and short-term features are discussed and indicate the promising potential of the new database for further analyses
and applications.},
