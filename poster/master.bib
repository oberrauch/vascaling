abstract = {Advance and retreat of temperate glaciers is largely controlled by changes in temper- ature and precipitation, but the relative importance of these drivers is debated. Numerical modeling of a New Zealand glacier reveals that temperature is the dominant control on glacier length. We find that a glacial advance, dated to ca. 13,000 yr B.P., requires a cooling event of 3–4 ?C. This mid-latitude Southern Hemisphere cooling is similar in magnitude to the Antarctic Cold Reversal in the Vostok ice core record and likely to be a response to the same climate signal},

abstract = {10Be dating of prominent glacier advances (stadials) in the Alps supports the correlation of the Gschnitz stadial ({\textgreater} 15.4??ka) with the Heinrich 1 ice rafting event (Greenland Stadial 2a), the Egesen-maximum advance (??? 12.3-12.4??ka) with the early Younger Dryas (Greenland Stadial 1), the Kartell advance (??? 10.8??ka) with the Preboreal Oscillation and the Kromer advance (??? 8.4??ka) with the Central European cold phase 3. The interpretation of the glacial record with glacier-climate models in terms of summer temperature change (??Ts) and precipitation change (??P) shows that climate during the Gschnitz stadial was ??? 10??K colder than at present and precipitation was reduced to ??? 25{\%} of modern annual sums with a possible tendency towards slightly more humid conditions in the southeastern Alps. During the early Younger Dryas, ??P depends on the estimated ??Ts. For a ??Ts of - 3.5??K, ??P along the northern fringe of the Eastern Alps was about 0 to + 15{\%}, in the central valleys ??P was in the order of - 20 to - 30{\%}. A scenario with a ??Ts of - 5??K leads to generally drier conditions (??? - 15{\%} vs. ??? - 50{\%} ??P) but the spatial pattern of precipitation change remains the same. The Kromer advance was possibly characterised by more humid conditions than today along the northern fringe of the Eastern Alps. In the valleys of the Central Alps, precipitation seems to have been similar to modern values. Methodologically, simple empirical relationships between summer temperature and precipitation at the equilibrium line altitude yield similar results as an analytical glacial-meteorological model. However, the analytical model allows a more detailed analysis of the climatic parameters influencing glacier behaviour. In the case of the Egesen-maximum and Kromer advances, the accuracy of ??P depends on the reliability of ??Ts, which is derived from timberline depression and on the dating control. In the case of the Gschnitz stadial, the accuracy of ??Ts depends mainly on the glacier flow model, from which ??P is derived. Since the model reacts sensitively to assumptions about basal sliding, only scenarios can be calculated. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Knowledge of the ice thickness distribution of glaciers and ice caps is an important prerequisite for many glaciological and hydrological investigations. A wealth of approaches has recently been presented for inferring ice thickness from characteristics of the surface. With the Ice Thickness Models Intercomparison eXperiment (ITMIX) we performed the first coordinated assessment quantifying individual model performance. A set of 17 different models showed that individual ice thickness estimates can differ considerably {\&}ndash; locally by a spread comparable to the observed thickness. Averaging the results of multiple models, however, significantly improved the results: On average over the 21 considered test cases, comparison against direct ice thickness measurements revealed deviations in the order of 10 {\&}pm; 24{\%} of the mean ice thickness (1-sigma estimate). For models relying on multiple data sets -- such as surface ice velocity fields, surface mass balance, or rates of ice thickness change {\&}ndash; the results highlighted the sensitivity to input data consistency. Together with the requirement of being able to handle large regions in an automated fashion, the capacity of better accounting for uncertainties in the input data will be a key for an improved next generation of ice thickness estimation approaches.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {A metbod is described to estimate the thickness of glacier ice using information derived from the measured ice extent, surface topography, surface mass balance, and rate of thinning or thickening of the ice column. Shear stress beneath an ice column is assumed to be simply related to ice thickness and surface slope, as for an inclined slab, but this calculation is cast as a linear optimization problem so that a smoothness regularization can be applied. Assignment of bed stress is based on tbe flow law for ice and a mass balance calculation but must be preceded by delineation of the ice flow drainage basin. Validation of the method is accomplished by comparing thickness estimates to the known thickness generated by a numerical ice dynamics model. Once validated, the method is used to estimate the subglacial topography for all glaciers in western Canada that lie south of 60°N. Adding the present ice volume of each glacier gives the estimated total volume as 2320 km'', equivalent to 5.8 mm of sea level rise. Taking tbe glaciated area as 26 590 km{\^{}} gives the average glacier thickness as 87.2 m. A detailed error analysis indicates that systematic errors are likely to increase the esti- mated sea level rise and when random errors are included the combined result is 6.3 ± 0.6 mm or, expressed as ice volume, 2530 ± 220 km{\^{}}.},

@article{Matthews2005,
abstract = {ABSTRACT. This review focuses on the development of the ‘Little Ice Age' as a glaciological and climatic concept, and evaluates its current usefulness in the light of new data on the glacier and climatic variations of the last millennium and of the Holocene. ‘Little Ice Age' glacierization occurred over about 650 years and can be defined most precisely in the European Alps (c. AD 1300–1950) when extended glaciers were larger than before or since. ‘Little Ice Age' climate is defined as a shorter time interval of about 330 years (c. AD 1570–1900) when Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures (land areas north of 20°N) fell significantly below the AD 1961–1990 mean. This climatic definition overlaps the times when the Alpine glaciers attained their latest two highstands (AD 1650 and 1850). It is emphasized, however, that ‘Little Ice Age' glacierization was highly dependent on winter precipitation and that ‘Little Ice Age' climate was not simply a matter of summer temperatures. Both the glacier-centred and the climate-centred concepts necessarily encompass considerable spatial and temporal variability, which are investigated using maps of mean summer temperature variations over the Northern Hemisphere at 30-year intervals from AD 1571 to 1900. ‘Little Ice Age'-type events occurred earlier in the Holocene as exemplified by at least seven glacier expansion episodes that have been identified in southern Norway. Such events provide a broader context and renewed relevance for the ‘Little Ice Age', which may be viewed as a ‘modern analogue' for the earlier events; and the likelihood that similar events will occur in the future has implications for climatic change in the twenty-first century. It is concluded that the concept of a ‘Little Ice Age' will remain useful only by (1) continuing to incorporate the temporal and spatial complexities of glacier and climatic variations as they become better known, and (2) by reflecting improved understanding of the Earth-atmosphere-ocean system and its forcing factors through the interaction of palaeoclimatic reconstruction with climate modelling.},

abstract = {Glacier fluctuations contribute to variations in sea level and historical glacier length fluctuations are natural in- dicators of past climate change. To study these subjects, long- term information of glacier change is needed. In this paper we present a data set of global long-term glacier length fluc- tuations. The data set is a compilation of available informa- tion on changes in glacier length worldwide, including both measured and reconstructed glacier length fluctuations. All 471 length series start before 1950 and cover at least four decades. The longest record starts in 1535, but the major- ity of time series start after 1850. The number of available records decreases again after 1962. The data set has global coverage including records from all continents. However, the Canadian Arctic is not represented in the data set. The avail- able glacier length series show relatively small fluctuations until the mid-19th century, followed by a global retreat. The retreat was strongest in the first half of the 20th century, al- though large variability in the length change of the differ- ent glaciers is observed. During the 20th century, calving glaciers retreated more than land-terminating glaciers, but their relative length change was approximately equal. Be- sides calving, the glacier slope is the most important glacier property determining length change: steep glaciers have re- treated less than glaciers with a gentle slope.},

abstract = {Understanding the response of relatively small ice masses to climate change on a century-to-century timescale is important because of their significant contribution to sea level change in the recent past, and their likely contribution in the next century. Franz Josef Glacier, with its excellent terminus position record, location in the Southern Hemisphere, and its extreme sensitivity to climatic changes, is a key data point for understanding the magnitude and mechanisms of past and future climate changes. Here, we use a reconstructed mass balance record to drive an ice flow model which simulates the general retreat of the glacier during the 20th century. The model is then used to project future glacier variations, based on regionally downscaled climate change scenarios. The results indicate that, under a mean climate change scenario, the glacier will retreat 5??km and lose 38{\%} of its mass by 2100. Different scenarios give a range of recession from 3.9 to 6.4??km, and a range of volume loss from 26{\%} to 58{\%}. On a global scale, the magnitude of the retreat is at the upper end of the range calculated for other, similar sized, glaciers. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A global compilation of glacier advances and retreats for the past two millennia grouped by 17 regions (excluding Antarctica) highlights the nature of glacier fluctuations during the late Holocene. The dataset includes 275 time series of glacier fluctuations based on historical, tree ring, lake sediment, radiocarbon and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide data. The most detailed and reliable series for individual glaciers and regional compilations are compared with summer temperature and, when available, winter precipitation reconstructions, the most important parameters for glacier mass balance. In many cases major glacier advances correlate with multi-decadal periods of decreased summer temperature. In a few cases, such as in Arctic Alaska and western Canada, some glacier advances occurred during relatively warm wet times. The timing and scale of glacier fluctuations over the past two millennia varies greatly from region to region. However, the number of glacier advances shows a clear pattern for the high, mid and low latitudes and, hence, points to common forcing factors acting at the global scale. Globally, during the first millennium CE glaciers were smaller than between the advances in 13th to early 20th centuries CE. The precise extent of glacier retreat in the first millennium is not well defined; however, the most conservative estimates indicate that during the 1st and 2nd centuries in some regions glaciers were smaller than at the end of 20th/early 21st centuries. Other periods of glacier retreat are identified regionally during the 5th and 8th centuries in the European Alps, in the 3rd???6th and 9th centuries in Norway, during the 10th???13th centuries in southern Alaska, and in the 18th century in Spitsbergen. However, no single period of common global glacier retreat of centennial duration, except for the past century, has yet been identified. In contrast, the view that the Little Ice Age was a period of global glacier expansion beginning in the 13th century (or earlier) and reaching a maximum in 17th???19th centuries is supported by our data. The pattern of glacier variations in the past two millennia corresponds with cooling in reconstructed temperature records at the continental and hemispheric scales. The number of glacier advances also broadly matches periods showing high volcanic activity and low solar irradiance over the past two millennia, although the resolution of most glacier chronologies is not enough for robust statistical correlations. Glacier retreat in the past 100???150 years corresponds to the anthropogenic global temperature increase. Many questions concerning the relative strength of forcing factors that drove glacier variations in the past 2??ka still remain.},

abstract = {The circulation of the ocean is usually divided into two parts, a wind-driven circulation that dominates in the upper few hundred meters, and a density-driven circulation that dominates below. The latter is called the ‘thermohaline' circulation because of the role of heating, cool- ing, freshening, and salinification in producing regional density differences within the ocean. The thermohaline circulation, for the most part, is an ‘overturning' circulation in which warm water flows poleward near the surface and is subsequently converted into cold water that sinks and flows equatorward in the in- terior. Radiocarbon measurements show that the thermohaline circulation turns over all the deep water in the ocean every 600 years or so},

abstract = {Mountain glaciers and their sediments are prominent witnesses of climate change, responding sensitively to even small modifications in meteorological parameters. Even in such a classical and thoroughly studied area as the European Alps the record of Holocene glacier mass-balance is only incompletely known. Here we explore a novel and continuous archive of glacier fluctuations in a cave system adjacent to the Upper Grindelwald Glacier in the Swiss Alps. Milchbach cave became partly ice-free only recently and hosts Holocene speleothems. Four coeval stalagmites show consistent petrographic and stable isotopic changes between 9.2 and 2.0ka which can be tied to abrupt modifications in the cave environment as a result of the closing and opening of multiple cave entrances by the waxing and waning of the nearby glacier. During periods of Holocene glacier advances, columnar calcite fabric is characterized by $\delta$18O values of about -8.0‰ indicative of speleothem growth under quasi-equilibrium conditions, i.e. little affected by kinetic effect related to forced degassing or biological processes. In contrast, fabrics formed during periods of glacier minima are typical of bacterially mediated calcite precipitation within caves overlain by an alpine soil cover. Moreover, $\delta$18O values of the bacterially mediated calcite fabrics are consistent with a ventilated cave system fostering kinetic fractionation. These data suggest that glacier retreats occurred repeatedly before 5.8ka, and that the amplitudes of glacier retreats became substantially smaller afterwards. Our reconstruction of the Upper Grindelwald Glacier fluctuations agrees well with paleoglaciological studies from other sites in the Alps and provides a higher temporal resolution compared to traditional analyses of peat and wood remains found in glacier forefields. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The term Little Ice Age was originally coined by F Matthes in 1939 to describe the most recent 4000 year climatic interval (the Late Holocene) associated with a particularly dramatic series of mountain glacier advances and retreats, analogous to, though considerably more moderate than, the Pleistocene glacial fluctuations. This relatively prolonged period has now become known as the Neoglacial period. The term Little Ice Age is, instead, reserved for the most extensive recent period ofmountain glacier expansion and is conventionally defined as the 16th–mid 19th century period during which European climate was most strongly impacted. This period begins with a trend towards enhanced glacial conditions in Europe following the warmer conditions of the so-called medieval warm period or medieval climatic optimum of Europe (see Medieval Climatic Optimum,Vol- ume 1), and terminates with the dramatic retreat of these glaciers during the 20th century. While there is evidence that many other regions outside Europe exhibited periods of cooler conditions, expanded glaciation, and significantly altered climate conditions, the timing and nature of these variations are highly variable from region to region, and the notion of the Little Ice Age as a globally synchronous cold period has all but been dismissed (Bradley and Jones, 1993; Mann et al., 1999). If defined as a large-scale event, the Little Ice Age must instead be considered a time of mod- est cooling of the Northern Hemisphere, with temperatures dropping by about 0.6 °C during the 15th–19th centuries (Bradley and Jones, 1993; Jones et al., 1998; Mann et al., 1998, 1999).},

abstract = {A nonlinear backpropagation network (BPN) has been trained with high-resolution multiproxy reconstructions of temperature and precipitation (input data) and glacier length variations of the Alpine Lower Grindelwald Glacier, Switzerland (output data). The model was then forced with two regional climate scenarios of temperature and precipitation derived from a probabilistic approach: The first scenario ("no change") assumes no changes in temperature and precipitation for the 2000-2050 period compared to the 1970-2000 mean. In the second scenario ("combined forcing") linear warming rates of 0.036-0.054 degrees C per year and changing precipitation rates between -17{\%} and +8{\%} compared to the 1970-2000 mean have been used for the 2000-2050 period. In the first case the Lower Grindelwald Glacier shows a continuous retreat until the 2020s when it reaches an equilibrium followed by a minor advance. For the second scenario a strong and continuous retreat of approximately -30 m/year since the 1990s has been modelled. By processing the used climate parameters with a sensitivity analysis based on neural networks we investigate the relative importance of different climate configurations for the Lower Grindelwald Glacier during four well-documented historical advance (1590-1610, 1690-1720, 1760-1780, 1810-1820) and retreat periods (1640-1665, 1780-1810, 1860-1880, 1945-1970). It is shown that different combinations of seasonal temperature and precipitation have led to glacier variations. In a similar manner, we establish the significance of precipitation and temperature for the well-known early eighteenth century advance and the twentieth century retreat of Nigardsbreen, a glacier in western Norway. We show that the maritime Nigardsbreen Glacier is more influenced by winter and/or spring precipitation than the Lower Grindelwald Glacier.},

abstract = {Little Ice Age (LIA) austral summer tempera-ture anomalies were derived from palaeoequilibrium line altitudes at 22 cirque glacier sites across the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Modern analog seasons with temperature anomalies akin to the LIA reconstructions were selected, and then applied in a sampling of high-resolution gridded New Zealand climate data and global reanalysis data to generate LIA climate composites at local, regional and hemispheric scales. The composite anomaly patterns assist in improving our understanding of atmospheric circulation contributions to the LIA climate state, allow an interroga-tion of synoptic type frequency changes for the LIA rela-tive to present, and provide a hemispheric context of the past conditions in New Zealand. An LIA summer temper-ature anomaly of -0.56 °C (±0.29 °C) for the Southern Alps based on palaeo-equilibrium lines compares well with local tree-ring reconstructions of austral summer tempera-ture. Reconstructed geopotential height at 1,000 hPa (z1000) suggests enhanced southwesterly flow across New Zealand occurred during the LIA to generate the terrestrial temperature anomalies. The mean atmospheric circulation pattern for summer resulted from a crucial reduction of the 'HSE'-blocking synoptic type (highs over and to the west of NZ; largely settled conditions) and increases in both the 'T'-and 'SW'-trough synoptic types (lows passing over NZ; enhanced southerly and southwesterly flow) relative to normal. Associated land-based temperature and precipita-tion anomalies suggest both colder-and wetter-than-nor-mal conditions were a pervasive component of the base climate state across New Zealand during the LIA, as were colder-than-normal Tasman Sea surface temperatures. Proxy temperature and circulation evidence were used to corroborate the spatially heterogeneous Southern Hemi-sphere composite z1000 and sea surface temperature pat-terns generated in this study. A comparison of the composites to climate mode archetypes suggests LIA summer climate and atmospheric circulation over New Zealand was driven by increased frequency of weak El Ni{\~{n}}o-Modoki in the tropical Pacific and negative Southern Annular Mode activity.},

abstract = {European Alpine glaciers are sensitive indicators of past climate and are thus valuable sources of climate history. Unfortunately, direct determinations of glacier changes (length variations and mass changes) did not start with increasing accuracy until just before the end of the 19th century. Therefore, historical and physical methods have to be used to reconstruct glacier variability for preceeding time periods. The Lower Grindelwald Glacier, Switzerland, and the Mer de Glace, France, are examples of well-documented Alpine glaciers with a wealth of different historical sources (e.g. drawings, paintings, prints, photographs, maps) that allow reconstruction of glacier length variations for the last 400-500 years. In this paper, we compare the length fluctuations of both glaciers for the 19th century until the present. During the 19th century a majority of Alpine glaciers - including the Lower Grindelwald Glacier and the Mer de Glace - have been affected by impressive glacier advances. The first maximum extent around 1820 has been documented by drawings from the artist Samuel Birmann, and the second maximum extent around 1855 is shown by photographs of the Bisson Brothers. These pictorial sources are among the best documents of the two glaciers for the 19th century. In addition to an analysis of historical sources of the 19th century, we also study the sensitivity of the Lower Grindelwald Glacier to climate parameters (multiproxy reconstructions of seasonal temperature and precipitation) for an advance and a retreat period in the 19th century using a new neural network approach. The advance towards 1820 was presumably driven by low summer temperatures and high autumn precipitation. The 1860-1880 retreat period was mainly forced by high temperatures. Finally, this nonlinear statistical approach is a new contribution to the various investigations of the complex climate-glacier system. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Coarse crystalline cryogenic cave carbonates (CCCcoarse) dated to the last glacial period are common in central European caves and provide convincing evidence of palaeo-permafrost during this time. Little is known, however, about the exact nature of the environment in which CCCcoarse formed as no modern analogue setting is known. Here, we report the first findings of sub-recent, albeit inactive, CCCcoarse from a cave of the Western Alps which is located in the present-day permafrost zone. The globular shape and the presence of ubiquitous euhedral crystal terminations are comparable to previously reported aggregates from the last glacial period and strongly suggest that these aggregates formed subaqueously in pools lacking agitation. Furthermore, stable isotope values of mm-sized spheroids point to calcite precipitation in a closed system with respect to CO2, strongly supporting the hypothesis of a cryogenic origin associated with the freezing of water ponds. U-series analyses revealed three clusters of late Holocene calcite precipitation intervals between 2129 and 751 a b2k. These ages correlate with known periods of elevated summer temperatures, suggesting that warming and thawing of the frozen catchment above the cave allowed water infiltration into the karst system. The growth of CCCcoarse resulted from the re-freezing of this water in the still cold karst cavities. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {$\backslash$nGeological records of mountain glacier fluctuations provide useful evidence for tracing the magnitude and rate of past temperature change. In this study, we present air temperature reconstructions for the last glacial termination in New Zealand derived using snowline reconstructions and numerical glacier modelling. We target the Arthur's Pass moraines in the Otira River catchment, which have previously been dated to the Lateglacial using cosmogenic 10Be. Recalculation of these exposure ages using a locally calibrated 10Be production rate indicates that these moraines formed ca. 16–14 ka. Our glacier modelling experiments and snowline reconstructions exhibit good agreement and show that the Arthur's Pass moraines formed in a climate that was 2.2–3.5 °C colder than present. Combining our results with other, proximal glacier records shows that ice in this catchment retreated ca. 50 km from the coastal plain to the main divide during the interval 17–15 ka, in response to a temperature increase of at least ca. 3 °C. Over half of this retreat occurred after the glacier had withdrawn from an overdeepened basin. Thus, we conclude that temperature increase was the primary driver of widespread and rapid glacier retreat in New Zealand at the onset of the last glacial termination.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Marine-based ice streams whose beds deepen inland are thought to be inherently unstable. This instability is of particular concern because signiﬁcant portions of the marinebased West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are losing mass and their retreat could contribute signiﬁcantly to future sea-level rise. However, the present understanding of icestream stability is limited by observational records that are too short to resolve multi-decadal to millennial-scale behaviour or to validate numerical models. Here we present a dynamic numerical simulation of Antarctic ice-stream retreat since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), constrained by geophysical data, whose behaviour is consistent with the geomorphological record. We ﬁnd that retreat of Marguerite Bay Ice Stream following the LGM was highly nonlinear and was interrupted by stabilizations on a reverse-sloping bed, where theory predicts rapid unstable retreat. We demonstrate that these transient stabilizations were caused by enhanced lateral drag as the ice stream narrowed. We conclude that, as well as bed topography, ice-stream width and long-term retreat history are crucial for understanding decadal- to centennial-scale ice-stream behaviour and marine ice-sheet vulnerability.},

abstract = {To predict the rate and consequences of shrinkage of the earth's mountain glaciers and ice caps, it is necessary to have improved regional-scale models of mountain glaciation and better knowledge of the subglacial topography upon which these models must operate. The problem of estimating glacier ice thickness is addressed by developing an artificial neural network ( ANN) approach that uses calculations performed on a digital elevation model (DEM) and on a mask of the present-day ice cover. Because suitable data from real glaciers are lacking, the ANN is trained by substituting the known topography of ice-denuded regions adjacent to the ice-covered regions of interest, and this known topography is hidden by imagining it to be ice-covered. For this training it is assumed that the topography is flooded to various levels by horizontal lake-like glaciers. The validity of this assumption and the estimation skill of the trained ANN is tested by predicting ice thickness for four 50 km x 50 km regions that are currently ice free but that have been partially glaciated using a numerical ice dynamics model. In this manner, predictions of ice thickness based on the neural network can be compared to the modeled ice thickness and the performance of the neural network can be evaluated and improved. From the results, thus far, it is found that ANN depth estimates can yield plausible subglacial topography with a representative rms elevation error of +/- 70 m and remarkably good estimates of ice volume.},

abstract = {We present the first speleothem-derived central North Africa rainfall record for the last glacial period. The record reveals three main wet periods at 65-61 ka, 52.5-50.5 ka and 37.5-33 ka that lead obliquity maxima and precession minima. We find additional minor wet episodes that are synchronous with Greenland interstadials. Our results demonstrate that sub-tropical hydrology is forced by both orbital cyclicity and North Atlantic moisture sources. The record shows that after the end of a Saharan wet phase around 70 ka ago, North Africa continued to intermittently receive substantially more rainfall than today, resulting in favourable environmental conditions for modern human expansion. The encounter and subsequent mixture of Neanderthals and modern humans – which, on genetic evidence, is considered to have occurred between 60 and 50 ka – occurred synchronously with the wet phase between 52.5 and 50.5 ka. Based on genetic evidence the dispersal of modern humans into Eurasia started less than 55 ka ago. This may have been initiated by dry conditions that prevailed in North Africa after 50.5 ka. The timing of a migration reversal of modern humans from Eurasia into North Africa is suggested to be coincident with the wet period between 37.5 and 33 ka.},

Tree ring series are standardized using an Adaptative Regional Growth Curve, which attempts to remove the age effect from the low frequency variations in the series. The proxies are calibrated using the June to August mean temperatures from the HISTALP high-elevation temperature time series spanning the 1818-2003. The method combines an analogue technique, which is able to extend the too short tree-ring series, an artificial neural network technique for an optimal non-linear calibration including a bootstrap technique for calculating error assessment on the reconstruction. About 50{\%} of the temperature variance is reconstructed. Low-elevation instrumental data back to 1760 compared to their instrumental target data reveal divergence between (warmer) early instrumental measurements and (colder) proxy estimates. The proxy record indicates cool conditions, from the mid-11th century to the mid-12th century, related to the Oort solar minimum followed by a short Medieval Warm Period (1200-1420). The Little Ice Age (1420-1830) appears particularly cold between 1420 and 1820 with summers that are 0.8 A degrees C cooler than the 1901-2000 period. The new record suggests that the persistency of the late 20th century warming trend is unprecedented. It also reveals significant similarities with other alpine reconstructions.},

abstract = {Glaciers in the European Alps began to retreat abruptly from their mid-19th century maximum, marking what appeared to be the end of the Little Ice Age. Alpine temperature and precipitation records suggest that glaciers should instead have continued to grow until circa 1910. Radiative forcing by increasing deposition of industrial black carbon to snow may represent the driver of the abrupt glacier retreats in the Alps that began in the mid-19th century. Ice cores indicate that black carbon concentrations increased abruptly in the mid-19th century and largely continued to increase into the 20th century, consistent with known increases in black carbon emissions from the industrialization of Western Europe. Inferred annual surface radiative forcings increased stepwise to 13-17 W⋅m(-2) between 1850 and 1880, and to 9-22 W⋅m(-2) in the early 1900s, with snowmelt season (April/May/June) forcings reaching greater than 35 W⋅m(-2) by the early 1900s. These snowmelt season radiative forcings would have resulted in additional annual snow melting of as much as 0.9 m water equivalent across the melt season. Simulations of glacier mass balances with radiative forcing-equivalent changes in atmospheric temperatures result in conservative estimates of accumulating negative mass balances of magnitude -15 m water equivalent by 1900 and -30 m water equivalent by 1930, magnitudes and timing consistent with the observed retreat. These results suggest a possible physical explanation for the abrupt retreat of glaciers in the Alps in the mid-19th century that is consistent with existing temperature and precipitation records and reconstructions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT. Studies addressing the response of glaciers to climate change have so far analyzed the effect of long-term trends in a particular set of meteorological variables only, implicitly assuming an unaltered climatic variability. Here a framework for distinguishing between year-to-year, month-to-month and day-to-day variability is proposed. Synthetically generated temperature and precipitation time series following the same long-term trend but with altered variability are then used to force an ice-dynamics model set up for Rhonegletscher, Swiss Alps. In the case of temperature, variations in the day-to-day variability are shown to have a larger effect than changes at the yearly scale, while in the case of precipitation, variability changes are assessed as having negligible impact. A first set of scenarios is used to show that compared to reference, doubling the temperature variability can reduce glacier ice volume by up to 64{\{}{\%}{\}} within half a decade. A second set derived from the results of the European ENSEMBLES project, however, shows that such changes are expected to remain below 8{\{}{\%}{\}} even for extreme scenarios. Although the latter results relativize the importance of the effect in the near future, the analyses indicate that at least caution is required when assuming ‘unchanged variability'.},

abstract = {Improving the late Quaternary paleoclimate record through climate interpretations of low-latitude glacier length changes advances our understanding of past climate change events and the mechanisms for past, present, and future climate change. Paleotemperature reconstructions at low-latitude glaciers are uniquely fruitful because they can provide both site-specific information and enhanced understanding of regional-scale variations due to the structure of the tropical atmosphere. We produce Little Ice Age (LIA) and Younger Dryas (YD) paleoclimate reconstructions for the Huancan{\'{e}} outlet glacier of the Quelccaya Ice Cap (QIC) and low-latitude southern hemisphere regional sea surface temperatures (SSTs) using a coupled ice-flow and energy balance model. We also model the effects of long-term changes in the summit temperature and precipitiation rate and the effects of interannual climate variability on the Huancan{\'{e}} glacier length. We find temperature to be the dominant climate driver of glacier length change. Also, we find that interannual climate variability cannot adequately explain glacier advances inferred from the geomorphic record, necessitating that these features were formed during past colder climates. To constrain our LIA reconstruction, we incorporate the QIC ice core record, finding a LIA air temperature cooling at the ice cap of between {\~{}}0.7 °C and {\~{}}1.1 °C and {\~{}}0.4 °C and regional SSTs cooling of {\~{}}0.6 °C. For the YD paleoclimate reconstructions, we propose two limits on the precipitation rate, since the ice core record does not extend into the Pleistocene: 1) the precipitation rate scales with the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship (upper limit on cooling) and 2) the precipitation rate increases by 40{\%} (lower limit on cooling), which is an increase about twice as great as the regional increases realized in GCM simulations for the period. The first limit requires {\~{}}1.6 °C cooling in ice cap air temperatures and {\~{}}0.9 °C cooling in SSTs, and the second limit requires {\~{}}1.0 °C cooling in ice cap air temperatures and {\~{}}0.5 °C cooling in SSTs. Our temperature reconstructions are in good agreement with the magnitude and trend of GCM simulations that incorporate the forcing mechanisms hypothesized to have caused these climate change events.},

abstract = {We explore the climatic information contained in the record of length fluctuations of Glaciar Fr{\'{i}}as, in the north Patagonian Andes of Argentina. This record is one of the longest and most detailed glacier records in southern South America, starting in 1639. In order to interpret the length variations of Glaciar Fr{\'{i}}as since the maximum Little Ice Age extent, we use a combination of a simplified surface energy-balance model to calculate the glacier mass balance, and a flowline model to account for the dynamical response of the glacier to changes in the climatic forcing. The overall retreat of the glacier observed over 1639-2009 is best explained by an annual mean temperature increase of 1.2 °C or a decrease in annual precipitation of 34{\%}, most of which would have occurred during the 20th century. The glacier model is also forced with two independent tree-ring and multi-proxy reconstructions of precipitation and temperature. The uncertainties in these reconstructions are rather large, leading to a wide range in the modelled glacier length that includes most of the observations. However, in both reconstructions, the mid-17th century seems to be too cold and the early 19th century too warm to explain the observed glacier lengths with the glacier model forced with the reconstructions. Forcing with reconstructed precipitation and temperature separately shows that the influence of historical variations in precipitation on the glacier fluctuations of Glaciar Fr{\'{i}}as is smaller than that of the temperature fluctuations. This suggests that the observed 1639-2009 retreat could be best explained by a warming close to 1.2 °C. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

The climatic reconstruction is presented in terms of Equilibrium-Line Altitude and is translated to envelopes of possible temperature and precipitation changes. The reconstruction is highly resolved between AD 1700 and 1990: the 20th Century retreat of the glacier resulted from a warming between AD 1920 and 1940 while the advance since AD 1970 was in response to both a cooling and a precipitation increase after AD 1940. The early 18th Century climate of Iceland was warm, comparable to that of the early 20th Century, while the coldest period in recent history occurred during the 1780s. Earlier Holocene glacier advances at about 5000, 3100 and 1400 yr BP, and in the 10th and 14th Centuries AD resulted from cooling of 1-2??C, and correlate with worldwide glacier expansion, atmospheric changes in Greenland and changes in ocean circulation north of Iceland. Glacier expansions follow periods when sea ice is extensive in the Greenland and Barents Sea. Resulting temperature changes mean that natural climatic variability has a large signature in Iceland, making it difficult to isolate any longer term trends, such as an enhanced anthropogenic signal. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

abstract = {High-resolution temperature and precipitation variations and their seasonal extremes since 1500 are presented for the European Alps (43.25-48.25N and 4.25-16.25E). The spatial resolution of the gridded reconstruction is given by 0.5 0.5 and monthly (seasonal) grids are reconstructed back to 1659 (1500-1658). The reconstructions are based on a combination of long instrumental station data and documentary proxy evidence applying principal component regression analysis. Annual, winter and summer Alpine temperatures indicate a transition from cold conditions prior to 1900 to present day warmth. Very harsh winters occurred at the turn of the seventeenth century. Warm summers were recorded around 1550, during the second half of the eighteenth century and towards the end of the twentieth century. The years 1994, 2000, 2002, and particularly 2003 were the warmest since 1500. Unlike temperature, precipitation variation over the European Alps showed no significant low-frequency trend and increased uncertainty back to 1500. The years 1540, 1921 and 2003 were very likely the driest in the context of the last 500 years.Running correlations between the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) and the Alpine temperature and precipitation reconstructions demonstrate the importance of this mode in explaining Alpine winter climate over the last centuries. Winter NAOI correlates positively with Alpine temperatures and negatively with precipitation. These correlations, however, are temporally unstable. We conclude that the Alps are situated in a band of varying influence of the NAO, and that other atmospheric circulation modes controled Alpine temperature and precipitation variability through the recent past.

abstract = {The Alps are often referred to as the ‘water tower of Europe'. In Switzerland, many branches of the economy, especially the hydropower industry, are closely linked to and dependent on the availability of water. Assessing the impact of climate change on streamflow runoff is, thus, of great interest. Major efforts have already been made in this respect, but the analyses often focus on individual catchments and are difficult to intercompare. In this article, we analysed nine high-alpine catchments spread over the Swiss Alps, selected for their relevance to a wide range of morphological characteristics. Runoff projections were carried out until the end of the current century by applying the Glacier Evolution Runoff Model (GERM) and climate scenarios generated in the framework of the ENSEMBLES project. We focused on assessing the uncertainty induced by the unknown climate evolution and provided general, statistically based statements, which should be useful as a ‘rule of thumb' for analyses addressing questions related to water management. Catchments with a high degree of glacierization will undergo the largest changes. General statements about absolute variations in discharge are unreliable, but an overall pattern, with an initial phase of increased annual discharge, followed by a phase with decreasing discharge, is recognizable for all catchments with a significant degree of glacierization. In these catchments, a transition from glacial and glacio-nival regime types to nival will occur. The timing of maximal annual runoff is projected to occur before 2050 in all basins. The time of year with maximal daily discharges is expected to occur earlier at a rate of 4Ð4 {\{}{\v{s}}{\}} 1Ð7 days per decade. Compared to its present level, the contribution of snow- and icemelt to annual discharge is projected to drop by 15 to 25{\{}{\%}{\}} until the year 2100.

abstract = {Quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions provide data for evaluating the mechanisms of past, natural climate variability. Geometries of former mountain glaciers, constrained by moraine mapping, afford the opportunity to reconstruct palaeoclimate, due to the close relationship between ice extent and local climate. In this study, we present results from a series of experiments using a 2-D coupled energy balance-ice flow model that investigate the palaeoclimate significance of Last Glacial Maximum moraines within nine catchments in the central North Island, New Zealand. We find that the former ice limits can be simulated when present-day temperatures are reduced by between 4 and 7°C, if precipitation remains unchanged from present. The spread in the results between the nine catchments is likely to represent the combination of chronological and model uncertainties. The majority of catchments targeted require temperature decreases of 5.1 to 6.3°C to simulate the former glaciers, which represents our best estimate of the temperature anomaly in the central North Island, New Zealand, during the Last Glacial Maximum. A decrease in precipitation of up to 25{\%} from present, as suggested by proxy evidence and climate models, increases the magnitude of the required temperature changes by up to 0.8°C. Glacier model experiments using reconstructed topographies that exclude the volume of post-glacial ({\textless} 15 ka) volcanism generally increased the magnitude of cooling required to simulate the former ice limits by up to 0.5°C. Our palaeotemperature estimates expand the spatial coverage of proxy-based quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions in New Zealand. Our results are also consistent with independent, proximal temperature reconstructions from fossil groundwater and pollen assemblages, as well as similar glacier modelling reconstructions from the central Southern Alps, which suggest air temperatures were ca. 6°C lower than present across New Zealand during the Last Glacial Maximum.},

abstract = {Glacier fluctuations are sensitive indicators of climate variability. Glacier length, though an indirect and delayed signal of climate information, can yet be used for the examination of the glacier-climate relationship. At the end of the 19th century, the first accurate measurements of glacier length fluctuations were carried out. Unfortunately, the preceding time of the Little Ice Age (LIA) is not documented by instrumental data, and interdisciplinary approaches that use both historical and physical methods are needed to reconstruct the behaviour of glaciers back in time. The Mer de Glace is a valley glacier 12 km long that is situated at the northern exposition of the Mont Blanc (France). Including all tributaries, it covers an area of about 32 km2 and spans an altitudinal range from 1500 to 4000 m asl. It is the longest and largest glacier of the western Alps. During the LIA, the Mer de Glace nearly continuously reached the bottom of the valley of Chamonix at 1000 m asl. The attractiveness of the landscape and the easy accessibility soon made the glacier a desirable object of study for scientists, artists and tourists, leading to a large number of historical documentary data. For the Mer de Glace, there exists a glacier length curve for the period from 1590 to 1911, made by Mougin (1912). Further investigations of glacier fluctuations during the late Holocene were made by Wetter (1987). The aim of the present study is to establish a revised and refined glacier length curve for the Mer de Glace, using newly available documentary data. The analysis and interpretation of historical documents allows the determination of former glacier extents. Documents containing pictorial information on the glacier ter- minus (drawings, paintings, prints, photographs, and maps) as well as texts (descrip- tions of the valley, etc.) are used. A rigorous selection of the documentary data (e.g., dating of a painting) is necessary in order to get reliable information, including the comparison of an old picture with today's situation in the field. Excellent examples of glacier representations of the Mer de Glace are given by the drawings of Jean-Antoine Linck (1766–1843) and Samuel Birmann (1793–1847), and the maps by James David Forbes (1809–1868) and Eug{\`{e}}ne Viollet-le-Duc (1814–1879). Additionally, moraines have been mapped for the determination of former glacier extents. The analysis of old topographical maps (from 1906, 1939, 1958, and 1967) and a photogrammetric evaluation of recent aerial photographs (from 2001) yield a detailed description of the present state of the glacier. The calculation of digital elevation models (DEMs) allows the quantification of volume changes for the Mer de Glace for the 20th century. The revised and refined glacier length curve for the Mer de Glace goes as far back as 1570. Not surprisingly, the glacier shows a generally large extent during the LIA. The largest glacier extension, documented by several archive texts and moraines, occurred around 1644. The largest glacier advance in the 19th century culminated in 1821 and is roughly 40 m smaller than the 1644 advance. A second advance in the 19th century occurred in 1852, with the glacier still lying roughly 70 m behind the well-formed 1821 moraines. Other major glacier advances are documented around 1600, 1720, and 1778. Since the 1850s, the glacier has retreated more or less con- tinuously (except for some minor advances, e.g. until 1995) by more than 2 km until the present-day. During the 20th century, the Mer de Glace shows a remarkable ice volume loss which mainly took place in the lower part of the glacier. The new glacier length curve is in good agreement with the curve made by Mougin (1912). However, significant differences occur around 1850, when the glacier extent seems to have been much more extensive than assumed by Mougin. Furthermore, the new documentary data allows a more detailed description of glacier fluctuations for the 1750–1820 period. The glacier extension around 1644 is roughly 100 m smaller than shown by the Mougin curve. A comparison of the Mer de Glace length curve with the one of the Unterer Grindelwaldgletscher (Zumb{\"{u}}hl, 1980; Zumb{\"{u}}hl et al., 1983) yields an astonishing simultaneity between the glaciers, despite the different settings in the western and central Alps. Small differences occur around 1855 (19th century maximum of the Unterer Grindelwaldgletscher) as well as between 1650 and 1750 (generally greater extension of the Mer de Glace with more variability). In order to further confirm the knowledge gained, it would be interesting to consider more Alpine glaciers, and also to extend the comparison by studying LIA glacier fluctuations in other parts of the world.},

With the ongoing climate warming, the retreat of mountain glaciers is a major concern. Predictions of glacier changes, necessarily need the present ice volume as initial condition, and for transient modelling, the ice thickness distribution has to be known. In this paper, a method based on mass conservation and principles of ice flow dynamics is applied to 62 glaciers located in the Swiss Alps for estimating their ice thickness distribution. All available direct ice thickness measurements are integrated. The ice volumes are referenced to the year 1999 by means of a mass balance time series. The results are used to calibrate a volume-area scaling relation, and the coefficients obtained show good agreement with values reported in the literature. We estimate the total ice volume present in the Swiss Alps in the year 1999 to be 74 ?? 9??km

The model presented in this paper, icetools, solves the Stokes equation including all components of the stress tensor, termed full Stokes, with the finite element method to enable such detailed studies. Icetools is capable of running in parallel on computational clusters providing the computing power for large-scale simulations. Two different numerical tests were performed to demonstrate the capability of the model; (1) a comparison with the analytical solution for gravity driven plane flow down an inclined plane, and (2) flow over a Gaussian-shaped bed disturbance in comparison with the analytical transfer functions for this case. The second test involves time evolution of the surface geometry from an initially uniformly sloping surface. A linear rheology medium with a viscosity of 8 × 1013 Pa s and a non-linear medium with Glen rheology exponent n = 3 and rate factor of A = 23 × 10- 16 s- 1 kPa- 3 were studied. Both correlate well with the analytical solution and reach steady state, defined as when the maximum vertical movement drops below 5 × 10- 5 times the mean ice thickness per year, after 282 years for the linear case and 135 years for the non-linear case, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we present a precisely dated, continuous terrestrial record of meteoric precipitation in Europe between 30 and 14.7 ka. In contrast to present-day conditions, our speleothem data provide strong evidence for preferential advection of moisture from the South across the Alps supporting a southward shift of the storm track during the local Last Glacial Maximum (that is, 26.5-23.5 ka). Moreover, our age control indicates that this circulation pattern preceded the Northern Hemisphere precession maximum by {\~{}}3 ka, suggesting that obliquity may have played a considerable role in the Alpine ice aggradation.},

abstract = {The recent fluctuation of the central Asian climate, and its effect on the region's glaciers, is poorly known, largely because of a lack of knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of so-called summer-accumulation-type glaciers. In this study, a one-dimensional numerical glacier model is used to simulate the dynamic response of Sofiyskiy glacier, Altai mountains, Russia, to climate forcing. A successful simulation of the observed historical front variations was accomplished by dynamic calibration. This resulted in a reconstruction of the recent mass-balance history of the glacier, showing a distinct decline in surface mass balance in the second half of the 19th century, a slightly higher mass balance at the beginning of the 20th century, followed by a steady decline towards present conditions. The future response of Sofiyskiy glacier was projected for six 21st-century climate scenarios. Under a "no-change" scenario, the glacier will retreat {\textgreater} 2 km, by 2100. If air temperature gradually rises by {\textgreater} 5degreesC during this century, the glacier will vanish around 2100. Basic response characteristics of Sofivskiy glacier were determined. These indicate rather low mass-balance sensitivity to temperature change, but a strong front reaction due to geometric conditions.},

abstract = {Deciphering pollen assemblages from alpine speleothems holds potential to provide unique information about past vegetation in rapidly changing environments. Here, we reconstruct subsurface aerosol transport at Milchbach cave (Switzerland, 1840??m??asl) based on the pollen content of two Holocene stalagmites. We demonstrate that pollen is chiefly associated with bacterially mediated calcite fabrics, typical of a well-ventilated cave system. In contrast, pollen is absent from columnar calcite fabrics confirming that hydrological transport is not a significant process for the incorporation of pollen into speleothems at Milchbach cave. Our results support significant changes in the subsurface ventilation regime, which can be associated with the waxing and waning of Upper Grindelwald glacier. Pollen assemblages obtained from six carbonate sub-samples attest the presence of a mixed deciduous forest in the Grindelwald valley during the early and middle Holocene, in agreement with coeval regional pollen records. This study demonstrates that even small amounts of calcite (0.3???2.8??cm3) are capable of delivering pollen spectra representative of the original vegetation if sufficiently elevated deposition fluxes are provided.},
