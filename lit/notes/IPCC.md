### Cross-Chapter Box 6 | Glacier Projections in Polar and High Mountain Regions

> AR5 included projections of 21st century glacier evolution from four process-based global-scale glacier models (Slangen and Van De Wal, 2011; Marzeion et al., 2012; Giesen and Oerlemans, 2013; Radić et al., 2014). Results have since been updated (Bliss et al., 2014; Slangen et al., 2017; Hock et al., 2019) using new glacier inventory data and/or climate projections, and projections from two additional models have been presented (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Huss and Hock, 2015). These six models were driven by climate projections from 8–21 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012) forced by various RCPs, and results are systematically compared in Hock et al. (2019).

Since the publication of AR5 in 2013, some of the global projections included in the report were updated using new inventories and/or climate projections (Bliss et al., 2014; Slangen et al., 2017; Hock et al., 2019). Additionally, two new models have been published by Hirabayashi et al. (2013) and Huss and Hock (2015).

For now, frontal ablation of water-terminating glaciers (i.e., calving and subaqueous melt) is only considered by Huss and Hock, 2015, and instability mechanism (Dunse et al., 2015; Sevestre et al., 2018; Willis et al., 2018) are not considered at all.

The polar regions (Antarctic periphery, Greenland periphery, Arctic Canada, Russian Arctic, Scandinavia, Iceland, Svalbard) contribute to about 80% of the total sea level rise by glaciers until 2100. The combined mass loss amounts to 16±7% and 33±11% relative to 2015 for the emission scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. For regions dominated by smaller mountain glaciers (Alps, Pyrenees, Caucasus, ...) the average ice loss exceeds 80% until 2100 under RCP8.5 but is not relevant for sea-level rise.

The global projections are consistent with regional projections computed from more sophisticated models (e.g., Kraaijenbrink et al. (2017) for High Mountain Asia, Clarke et al. (2015) for western Canada, Zekkolari et al. (2019) for the European Alps).

Current glacier geometries are in a state of imbalance with current climate and would continue to retreat even without further warming (Mernild et al., 2013; Marzeion et al., 2018).
