**David B. Bahr (1997) - Water Resources Resaerch - https://doi.org/10.1029/97WR00824**

**Abstract**:

> [...] this work shows that scaling relationships from the continuum dynamics of ice can link the distribution of surface areas to the global and regional distributions of any other continuum property (Bahr, 1997)
