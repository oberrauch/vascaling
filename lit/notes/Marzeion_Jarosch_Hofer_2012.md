## Abstract:

> We present estimates of sea-level change caused by the global surface mass balance of glaciers, based on the reconstruction and projection of the surface mass balance of all the individual glaciers of the world, excluding the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The model is validated using a leave-one-glacier-out cross-validation scheme against 3997 observed surface mass balances of 255 glaciers, and against 756 geodetically observed, temporally integrated volume and surface area changes of 341 glaciers. When forced with observed monthly precipitation and temperature data, the glaciers of the world are reconstructed to have lost mass corresponding to 114±5mm sea-level equivalent (SLE) between 1902 and 2009. Using projected tempera- ture and precipitation anomalies from 15 coupled general circulation models from the Coupled Model Intercompari- son Project phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble, they are projected to lose an additional 148±35mm SLE (scenario RCP26), 166±42mm SLE (scenario RCP45), 175±40mm SLE (scenario RCP60), or 217±47mm SLE (scenario RCP85) during the 21st century. Based on the extended RCP sce- narios, glaciers are projected to approach a new equilibrium towards the end of the 23rd century, after having lost ei- ther 248±66mm SLE (scenario RCP26), 313±50mm SLE (scenario RCP45), or 424±46mm SLE (scenario RCP85). Up until approximately 2100, ensemble uncertainty within each scenario is the biggest source of uncertainty for the future glacier mass loss; after that, the difference between the scenarios takes over as the biggest source of uncer- tainty. Ice mass loss rates are projected to peak 2040 ∼ 2050 (RCP26), 2050 ∼ 2060 (RCP45), 2070 ∼ 2090 (RCP60), or 2070 ∼ 2100 (RCP85).

## 9. Conclusion

The conclusion is very concise and could be copied hereafter in its entirety. Instead, the key points are summarized below:

- the paper describes the construction, validation and application of the global surface mass balance model
- the model simulates past and future glacier states from 1850 to 2300 using observed climate data, model based climate reconstruction and projections
- observations of mass balance, area and volume changes of individual glaciers can be reproduced by the model
- the global ice loss from 1902 to 2009 is estimated to be 114±5 mm SLE (sea-level equivalent)
- the peak of glacier mass loss lies between 2040 and 2100 depending on the chosen RCP scenario, while a new equilibrium is approached around the end of the 23rd century for all RCPs
- the projected global ice mass loss depends strongly on the chosen RCP scenario: from less than 50% mass loss to nearly complete deglaciation with >450 mm SLE
- the ensemble spread is the major factor of uncertainty during the 21st century superseded by emission scenario uncertainty towards the end of the simulations

## 1. Introduction

Same story as usual: glaciers make slow and hardly perceivable changes of climate visible to humans; glacier retreat is important for sea-level rise, water availability and geo-hazards.

### Past contributions of glaciers and ice caps to sea-level rise:

- [x] **Cogley (2009): Geodetic and direct mass balance measurements: comparison and joint analysis**

  > **Abstract:** This paper describes a new compilation of both direct and geodetic mass-balance measurements, develops a procedure to reduce diverse balance measurements over different time-spans to common time-spans, and presents updated estimates of global average balance of small glaciers based on the enlarged compilation. Although geodetic measurements are fewer than direct measurements, they cover four times as many balance years. Direct and geodetic measurements are unbiased with respect to one another, but differences are often substantial. The statistical procedure can be understood by imagining that an *n*-year balance measurement is an average of a series of 1 year measurements. The series is hypothetical but we can calculate the uncertainty of each of its elements if, in addition to its measured average, we can also estimate its standard deviation. For this claim to be valid, the annual series must be stationary and normally distributed with independent (roughly, uncorrelated) elements, for which there is reasonable evidence. The need to know the standard deviation means that annual direct measurements from a nearby glacier, or equally reliable information about variability, are indispensable. Given this information, the new methodology results in moderately more negative balances. This is probably because tidewater glaciers are better represented in the geodetic data. In any case, the most recent published estimate of global average balance, 0.8 – 1.0 mm a^–1^ of sea-level equivalent for 2001 – 2004, is now increased substantially to 1.1–1.4 mm a^–1^ for 2001 – 2005.

  Not really interesting... estimates the contribution of sea-level rise to 1.1 - 1.4 mm a^–1^ between 2001 and 2005 from a combination of geodetic and direct mass balance measurements. This is done by a new statistical procedure, which treats multi-year geodetic measurements as a series of hypothetical yearly measurements and estimates their uncertainty based on the standard deviation of nearby direct measurements

  > **Abstract:** Glaciers play an important role for freshwater resources, but in global-scale freshwater assessments, their impact on river flows has not yet been taken into account. As a first step, we developed a global glacier model that can be coupled to global land surface and hydrological models. With a spatial resolution of 0.5° by 0.5°, the glacier model HYOGA computes glacier mass balance by a simple degree-day approach for 50 m sub-grid elevation bands, modeling all glaciers within a grid cell as one glacier. The model is tuned individually for each grid cell against observed glacier mass balance data. HYOGA is able to compute glacier mass balances reasonably well, even those of summer accumulation type glaciers. Still, model uncertainty is high, which is, among other reasons, due to the uncertainty of global data sets of temperature and precipitation which do not represent well the climatic situation at glacier sites. We developed a 59-yr (1948–2006) time series of global glacier mass balance and glacier area by driving HYOGA with daily near-surface atmospheric data. According to our computations, most glaciers have lost mass during the study period. Compared to estimates derived from a rather small number of observed glacier mass balances, HYOGA computes larger glacier mass losses in Asia, Europe, Canadian Arctic islands and Svalbard. In accordance with the estimates, average annual mass losses have increased strongly after 1990 as compared to the 30 years before. The sea level equivalent of the melt water from glaciers is 0.76 mm/yr water equivalent after 1990 as compared to only 0.34 mm/yr water equivalent before. We computed an acceleration of glacier mass losses after 1990 for all world regions except South America, where the number of gauge observations of precipitation is very small after 1980.

  > **Abstract:** In this study, a new estimate of the contribution of glaciers and ice caps to the sea-level rise over the period 1800–2005 is presented. We exploit the available information on changes in glacier length. Length records form the only direct evidence of glacier change that has potential global coverage before 1950. We calculate a globally representative signal from 349 glacier length records. By means of scaling, we deduce a global glacier volume signal, that is calibrated on the mass-balance and geodetic observations of the period 1950–2005. We find that the glacier contribution to sea-level rise was 8.4 ± 2.1 cm for the period 1800–2005 and 9.1 ± 2.3 cm for the period 1850–2005.

> Besides the practical difficulties of modeling vast numbers of glaciers, the undersampling problem imposes strong limits on (i) the number of model parameters that can be determined empirically, and (ii) the reliability and representativeness of these parameter estimates. Therefore, some recent efforts have circumvented the problem of direct modeling [...]

### Previously published studies circumventing the problems of modeling:

Prior to this study there was no independently validated glacier model that projected global glacier ice volume for the 21st century. The limited availability of long term glacier mass balance records makes it difficult to empirically determine model parameters with a needed reliability and representativeness. The following recent (in 2012, not today) papers try to circumvent these problems arising from direct modeling:

- [x] **Meier et al. (2007): Glaciers dominate eustatic sea-level rise in the 21st century**

  > Ice loss to the sea currently accounts for virtually all of the sea-level rise that is not attributable to ocean warming, and about 60% of the ice loss is from glaciers and ice caps rather than from the two ice sheets. The contribution of these smaller glaciers has accelerated over the past decade, in part due to marked thinning and retreat of marine-terminating glaciers associated with a dynamic instability that is generally not considered in mass-balance and climate modeling. This acceleration of glacier melt may cause 0.1 to 0.25 meter of additional sea-level rise by 2100.

  **Definition** *eustatic sea level*: the eustatic sea level is the distance from the Earth's core to the ocean surface, see [wikipedia.org][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustatic_sea_level]

  Estimation of future (> 2006) glacier ice wastage by extrapolating observations of current (1995 - 2005) mass loss rates ($\dot M$) and past (1950 - 2005) mass loss acceleration ($\ddot M$). Continued warming of (sub)polar regions further increases the dynamic forcing on glacier geometry changes.

  > It is conventionally assumed that under near–steady state conditions, the climatically controlled surface balance (inputs by snow and loss through melt) controls the geometry of an ice mass, and geometric transitions (changes in thickness) are forced by changes in surface mass balance. In contrast, under dynamically forced conditions, changes in ice velocity are forced instead by changes in subglacial mechanics, and geometric transitions are governed by changes in flux divergence rather than surface balance.

  Ice thickness changes (and other geometric transitions) are dominated by changes surface mass balance for glaciers in near steady state and by changes in flux divergence otherwise. Additionally, under non-equilibrium conditions changes in subglacial mechanics force changes in ice velocities. The contribution of dynamically forced ice loss, especially of marine-terminating glaciers (i.e., calving), is underestimated due to a lack of reported values.

- [x] **Pfeffer et al. (2008): Kinematic constraints on glacier contributions to 21st-century sea-level rise**

  > On the basis of climate modeling and analogies with past conditions, the potential for multimeter increases in sea level by the end of the 21st century has been proposed. We consider glaciological conditions required for large sea-level rise to occur by 2100 and conclude that increases in excess of 2 meters are physically untenable. We find that a total sea-level rise of about 2 meters by 2100 could occur under physically possible glaciological conditions but only if all variables are quickly accelerated to extremely high limits. More plausible but still accelerated conditions lead to total sea-level rise by 2100 of about 0.8 meter. These roughly constrained scenarios provide a "most likely" starting point for refinements in sea-level forecasts that include ice flow dynamics.

  Pfeffer et al. (2008) predefine sea-level rise "targets" and investigate the plausibility of scenarios needed to meet the said targets.

- [x] **Bahr et al. (2009): Sea-level rise from glaciers and ice caps: a lower bound**

  > **Abstract:** One of the most easily measured dimensions of a glacier, the accumulation area, is linked to future changes in glacier volume and consequent changes in sea level. Currently observed accumulation areas are too small [to sustain an equilibrium], forcing glaciers to lose 27% of their volume to attain equilibrium with current climate. As a result, at least 184 ± 33 mm of sea‐level rise are necessitated by mass wastage of the world's mountain glaciers and ice caps even if the climate does not continue to warm. If the climate continues to warm along current trends, a minimum of 373 ± 21 mm of sea‐level rise over the next 100 years is expected from glaciers and ice caps. When compared to recent estimates from all other sources, melt water from glaciers must be considered as a particularly important fraction of the total sea‐level rise expected this century.

  Using volume/accumulation-area-ratio (AAR) scaling to estimate changes in volume from changes in surface area (or AAR). A representative dataset of AAR data is used to compute average relative volume change, which is then multiplied by the number of glaciers to get a global estimate. The estimation relies on a constant mean AAR or a constant trend in AAR from past and current observations. Additionally, calving glaciers are not considered.

### Previously published modeling approaches:

- [x] **Raper and Braithwaite (2006): Low sea level rise projections from mountain glaciers and ice caps under global warming**

  > The mean sea level has been projected to rise in the 21st century as a result of global warming. Such projections of sea level change depend on estimated future greenhouse emissions and on differing models, but model-average results from a mid-range scenario (A1B) suggests a 0.387 m rise by 2100 (refs 1, 2). The largest contributions to sea level rise are estimated to come from thermal expansion (0.288 m) and the melting of mountain glaciers and icecaps (0.106 m), with smaller inputs from Greenland (0.024 m) and Antarctica (- 0.074 m). Here we apply a melt model and a geometric volume model to our lower estimate of ice volume and assess the contribution of glaciers to sea level rise, excluding those in Greenland and Antarctica. We provide the first separate assessment of melt contributions from mountain glaciers and icecaps, as well as an improved treatment of volume shrinkage. We find that icecaps melt more slowly than mountain glaciers, whose area declines rapidly in the 21st century, making glaciers a limiting source for ice melt. Using two climate models, we project sea level rise due to melting of mountain glaciers and icecaps to be 0.046 and 0.051 m by 2100, about half that of previous projections.

  Combination of a degree-day model (Braithwaite et al., 2002) and a volume/area scaling model (Raper et al., 2000) to estimate global glacier volume and sea-level rise due to global warming during the 21st century. Probably the first paper in this directions, however with some caveats. The model runs on a rather coarse 1° grid. The mass balance model can run only for seven regions with sufficient data coverage. A multiple linear regression (with annual precipitation and summer temperatures as explanatory variables and mass balance gradient as dependent variable) is computed from the mass balance profiles of each single grid cell of the seven regions. The regression is used to extrapolate the results of the mass balance model to all other regions. Statistical glacier characteristics like volume and area distribution, area-elevation distribution and elevation range are estimated for each grid cell. Comment from Bahr et al. (2015): the coarse 1° grid creates multiple problems for the volume/area scaling model. On the one hand, multiple glaciers are combined in a single cell, i.e., treated as glacier complexes. On the other hand, single glaciers are subdivided along grid cell boundaries. Volume/area scaling should not be applied to glacier complexes, nor to fractional parts of glaciers (Bahr et al., 2015, Section 8.6).

- [x] **Radic and Hock (2011): Regionally different contribution of mountain glaciers and ice caps to future sea-level rise**

  > The contribution to sea-level rise from mountain glaciers and ice caps has grown over the past decades. They are expected to remain an important component of eustatic sea-level rise for at least another century, despite indications of accelerated wastage of the ice sheets. However, it is difficult to project the future contribution of these small-scale glaciers to sea-level rise on a global scale. Here, we project their volume changes due to melt in response to transient, spatially differentiated twenty-first century projections of temperature and precipitation from ten global climate models. We conduct the simulations directly on the more than 120,000 glaciers now available in the World Glacier Inventory, and upscale the changes to 19 regions that contain all mountain glaciers and ice caps in the world (excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets). According to our multi-model mean, sea-level rise from glacier wastage by 2100 will amount to 0.124 ± 0.037 m, with the largest contribution from glaciers in Arctic Canada, Alaska and Antarctica. Total glacier volume will be reduced by 21 ± 6%, but some regions are projected to lose up to 75% of their present ice volume. Ice losses on such a scale may have substantial impacts on regional hydrology and water availability.
  
  This study is motivated by the discrepancies in the few 21st century projections of global mass loss of glaciers and ice caps and its contribution to sea-level rise.
  
  Elevation dependent surface mass balance model is calibrated with available observations of seasonal mass balance profiles of 36 glaciers and forced by monthly temperature reanalysis and precipitation climatologies. Transfer functions based on multiple linear regressions are used to extrapolate mass balance calibration parameters and to all global glaciers (i.e., ~120'000 glaciers and ~2600 ice caps which cover about 40% of the total global glacier area). Area-averaged mass balance estimates for 41 glacier regions (based on observations from over 300 glaciers ) are used to tune the model by an iterative process, which impedes an independent model validation with 20th century observations. The same area-averaged mass balance estimates are then used for initialization.
  
  The calibrated an initialized model runs with downscaled monthly temperature and precipitation projections of ten different GCMs, based on a mid-range emission scenario. Volume/area and volume/length scaling is used to update glacier geometries and allow for a potential new equilibrium under a changed climate.

## 3. Cross-validation of the mass balance model

A leave-one-glacier-out cross-validation for all 255 reference glaciers results in almost 4000 pairs of measured and independently modeled mass balance. The model performance is good on the global level, less so on the regional level. Most concerning is the large mean bias of certain regions, which indicated that future mass balance predictions may be wrong.

The RMSE between modeled and measured mass balances is independent of surface area and number of mass balance measurement. There is a low correlation between RSME and remoteness of the glacier (i.e., mean distance to the ten closest reference glaciers). This extends to the mass balance bias.

Other parameters choices (number of closest glaciers, weighting with $\beta^*$ vs. distance or a combination of both) have little to no effect on the model performance. However, reducing the number of reference glaciers (by  e.g., requiring a longer mass balance record) drastically increases the RMSE.

## 4. Treatment of uncertainty

- Uncertainties from the mass balance model itself and the forcing of the model are partially captured by the RMSE. However, the observations are available only for comparably short periods of time. Changes in glacier length and thereby terminus elevation and terminus temperature take place over longer periods of time. Hence, the error in terminus temperature $\epsilon(T^\text{terminus})$ is incorporated into the mass balance error $\epsilon(B_\text{modeled})$ for any single year as
  $$
  \epsilon(B_\text{modeled}) = \sqrt{\overline{\text{rmse}}^2 + n\cdot(\mu^*\cdot\epsilon(T^\text{terminus}))^2}.
  $$
  Hereby, $n$ is the number of month where ice melt occurs ($T^\text{teminus} > T^\text{melt}$). This indicates that natural climate variability or a climatic trend results in variable mass balance error or a trend in mass balance error.
